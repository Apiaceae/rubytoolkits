Asplenium adiantum-nigrum, an allotetraploid species that originated via chromosome doubling in a hybrid (A. ×ligusticum Bernardello et al.) between A. cuneifolium Viviani and A. onopteris Linnaeus, is unrelated to the distantly similar A. interjectum. Asplenium adiantum-nigrum differs by the thickened stipe base (trophopod) and the less deltoid lamina.

Asplenium aethiopicum is a morphologically, ecologically, and karyologically very variable aggregate for which we prefer to use the oldest available epithet. Braithwaite (Cytotax. Invest. Asplenium aethiopicum Complex Africa, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Leeds. 1964; Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 93: 348-378. 1986), Panigrahi (Phytologia 31: 251-258. 1975), Manton et al. (Bull. Brit. Mus. (Nat. Hist.), Bot. 15: 123-161. 1986), and Ormonde (Bol. Mus. Munic. Funchal 43: 177-189. 1991; Acta Bot. Malac. 16: 293-315. 1991) have shown that A. aethiopicum s.l. is an aggregate of at least three sexual (A. aethiopicum subsp. tripinnatum (Baker) A. F. Braithwaite (4x), A. aethiopicum subsp. aethiopicum (8x), and A. aethiopicum subsp. dodecaploideum A. F. Braithwaite (12x)) and up to five apomictic taxa. Most of these cytotypes are common in Africa, but sexual tetraploids and dodecaploids are also known from Asia and America, where Swartzs name, A. praemorsum, is used for the aggregate. Besides differing in chromosome number and pairing behavior, the members of this aggregate can also be separated on the basis of their exospore size. The agamosporous taxa can be distinguished from the sexual by the length/width ratio of their spores: agamosporous taxa have subglobose spores with a ratio smaller than 1.4, sexual taxa have reniform to plano-convex spores with a ratio larger than 1.4. Based on Braithwaites (Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 93: 343-378. 1986) key, Chinese specimens are probably sexual A. aethiopicum subsp. dodecaploideum but need cytological confirmation. We found hybrids with A. austrochinense in Jiangxi.

Asplenium spathulinum J. Smith ex Hooker (1860), not Kunze (1848).

Plants 30-65 cm tall. Rhizome erect or ascending, scaly; scales brown, narrowly triangular, margins subdentate. Fronds caespitose; stipe dull grayish brown to gray-green, semiterete, 13-30 cm, subglabrous, adaxially sulcate; lamina triangular to ovate, 21-36 × 10-20 cm, not much reduced at base, apex acute-acuminate, bipinnate; pinnae 12-18 pairs, subopposite to alternate, stalks 2-3 mm, basal pinnae largest or slightly reduced, narrowly triangular, 7-14 × 3.5-4.5 cm, apex variable, from acute to caudate, 1-pinnate; pinnules 4-8 pairs, anadromous, free to subsessile, from ovate-elliptic to rhombic or cuneiform, apex obtuse, basal acroscopic pinnule ± equal to basal basiscopic pinnule, basal pair largest, 1.5-3 × 1-1.3 cm, base nearly symmetrical, cuneate, distal segments decurrent on rachis, lateral sides entire, outer margin dentate to crenate. Costa obvious on both sides, raised abaxially, adaxially shallowly grooved with raised supravascular ridge, veins 2- or 3-forked and not reaching margin. Fronds herbaceous, brownish green when dry, subglabrous; rachis grayish brown to gray-green, adaxially sulcate, apical part of rachis often gemmiferous. Sori 1-4 per pinnule, not reaching margin, linear, 5-10 mm; indusia brownish, linear, membranous, entire, opening toward costa or costule, persistent.





Epiphytic in forests; 600-1400 m. Hainan [Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka; Mascarene Islands].

Hookers name, Asplenium spathulinum, has often been used to describe this variable taxon (e.g., Beddome, Ferns S. India, t. 226. 1864; Tardieu & Ching, Notul. Syst. (Paris) 5: 134-154. 1936; Holttum, Revis. Fl. Malaya 2: 439. 1954; Copeland, Fern Fl. Philipp. 3: 445. 1960; Chun et al., Fl. Hainan. 1: 116. 1964; S. H. Wu, FRPS 4(2): 70. 1999; T. L. Wu et al., Fl. Guangdong 7: 198. 2006). Manton and Sledge (Philos. Trans., Ser. B, 238: 127-185. 1954) showed that A. affine is an aggregate of an octoploid and a dodecaploid species (S India and Sri Lanka). Plants from closer to the type locality of Mauritius, in Réunion, were dodecaploid. Because specimens from the Hainan populations have the same ploidy level (12x), we use the name A. affine following Sledges (Bull. Brit. Mus. (Nat. Hist.), Bot. 3: 235-277. 1965) concept, based on morphological and cytological study. Mature A. affine plants can be very similar to juvenile specimens of A. pseudolaserpitiifolium and its relatives.

Asplenium atuntzeense Viane & Reichstein; A. daghestanicum Christ subsp. aitchisonii (Fraser-Jenkins & Reichstein) Fraser-Jenkins; A. minutum Chang Y. Yang (1993), not Willdenow ex Klotsch (1847); A. subdigitatum Ching (1985), not Mettenius ex Kuhn (1868); A. xinjiangense Ching.

Plants 8-18 cm tall. Rhizome short, erect to ascending, apex scaly; scales dark brown, ovate-triangular, 2-4 mm, often with marginal fimbriae. Fronds caespitose, bright to dark green, (2-)7-11(-15) cm; stipe usually as long as (up to 1/3 of) lamina, 2-6 cm, semiterete, base dark brown for 2-15 mm but green toward rachis, with narrow scales and uniseriate hairs, subglabrous when old; lamina narrowly triangular to ovate, base widest, (2-)3-6 × (0.5-)1-2(-3) cm, bipinnate at base, apex acute; pinnae 5-10 pairs, subopposite or alternate, basal pinnae with short stalks 0.5-2(-3) mm, upper pinnae sessile, basal pinnae usually largest, triangular to deltoid, 3-12(-18) × 3-10(-15) mm, apex obtuse, lowest pinnae 0.5-2 cm apart, each usually with 2 pinnules and broad, deeply pinnatifid apex, upper pinnae smaller, less divided and entire near apex; ultimate segments with cuneiform base and obtuse apex, margin dentate, with 3-5(-7) spreading teeth. Costa obvious but veins obscure, veins anadromously branching. Frond herbaceous, green to brown-green when dried, rachis semiterete, green, with narrow scales and uniseriate hairs; average guard cell length 56-61 µm. Sori submedian to median on subtending vein, confluent when mature, 2-3 mm; indusia membranous, repand to entire, opening toward costule or toward costa. Spores with lophate (costate to cristate) perispore, average exospore length 38-42 µm. Sexual hexaploid species: 2n = 216.





On half-shaded, non-calcareous rocks; 1700-4200 m. S Gansu, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Xizang, Yunnan [Bhutan, N India, Nepal, Pakistan].

Asplenium aitchisonii is similar to other members of the A. varians complex (i.e., A. altajense, A. kukkonenii, A. semivarians, A. tenuicaule, A. varians) and was often included in A. varians, e.g., by Beddome (Handb. Ferns Brit. India, 158. 1883), Hope (J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 13: 667. 1901), Stewart (Biologia 3: 133-164. 1957), and Stewart in Nasir and Ali (Fl. W. Pakistan, 18. 1972); however, it is usually widest at the base and has longer stomata and spores due to its higher number of chromosomes. This is an allohexaploid (not an octoploid as stated in the original description). Asplenium daghestanicum Christ, a tetraploid from the Caucasus and Libya (Tibesti), is genetically isolated from this species and thus better kept as a separate species. Plants from isolated populations, growing in sheltered conditions in regions with an extreme climate, are often less developed and have been described as separate species (i.e., A. xinjiangense, A. subdigitatum, A. minutum).

In crevices of shaded rocks; 400-1500 m. Nei Mongol, Ningxia, Sichuan, Xinjiang [Mongolia, Russia (Altai, S Siberia)].

Asplenium altajense is relatively common in the area bordering China, the Altai Mountains, Mongolia, and Russia, but future research will have to show if the area given by Grubov (Rast. Tsentral. Azii 1: 82. 1963) is correct. In general shape, this taxon is similar to A. pekinense Hance. However, most pinnae of A. altajense have only the basal acroscopic pinnule free, the others are confluent and form the pinna apex, while in A. pekinense several segments are free or just slightly adnate to the costa. The stipe is less scaly in A. altajense, and its texture is more herbaceous. Asplenium altajense is also similar to A. tenuicaule, from which it can be distinguished by the more narrow and acute teeth (obtuse to mucronate in A. tenuicaule). Due to confusion between A. tenuicaule, A. pekinense, and A. anogrammoides, the distribution of this taxon is not well known. Asplenium chingianum (type fragment in IBSC!) is a submature plant with immature sporangia, few and unripe spores, and almost no scales; it is also similar to A. nesii specimens from N Pakistan. The hybrid between A. altajense and A. tenuicaule is relatively common where they grow together.

Asplenium anogrammoides is an (allo)tetraploid (Kurita, J. Jap. Bot. 35: 269-272. 1960; Mitui, Sci. Rep. Tokyo Kyoiku Daigaku, B, 13: 285-333. 1968) and originated via chromosome doubling in the sterile hybrid between A. sarelii and A. tenuicaule (Lin & Sleep in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 111-127. 1989; Murakami et al., Amer. Fern J. 89: 232-243. 1999; Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003; Wang, Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 1-14. 2003). Their morphological similarity led to much confusion and misapplication of the name A. sarelii to this taxon (also called "tetraploid sarelii") (e.g., Christensen, Acta Horti Gothob. 1: 41-110. 1924; Ogata, Icon. Fil. Jap. 1: t. 8. 1928; Tardieu, Asplén. Tonkin, 46. 1932; Ching, Icon. Fil. Sin. 3: t. 111. 1935, p.p.; Fl. Pl. Herb. Chin. Bor.-Or. 1: 37. 1958; De Vol, Mus. Heude. Notes Bot.

Educ. 4: 221-271. 1975; Kurata & Nakaike, Ill. Pterid. Jap. 2: 164-173. 1981; Ding & Gao, Fl. Henan 1: 67. 1981; Sleep & Reichstein, Candollea 39: 675-691. 1984; Ching & S. H. Wu, Acta Phytotax. Sin. 23: 1-10. 1985; Jiang, Fl. Anhui 1: 136. 1985, p.p.; Bir, Biol. Indian Pterid. 215-221. 1987; Jamir & Rao, Ferns Nagaland, 289-290. 1988; H. S. Kung, Fl. Sichuan. 6: 377. 1989; Chen, Fl. Shandong 1: 96. 1990; Li, Fl. Liaoning 1: 77. 1990, p.p.; L. K. Lin, Fl. Fujian. 1: 131. 1991; Iwatsuki, Ferns Jap. 146. 1992; Fl. Jap. 1: 104. 1995; Murakami et al., loc. cit.; S. H. Wu, FRPS 4(2): 98. 1999, p.p.; P. S. Wang & X. Y. Wang, Pterid. Fl. Guizhou, 138. 2001, p.p.; Li et al., Fl. Hunan 1: 287. 2004, p.p.; G. F. Zhang, Fl. Yunnan. 20: 669. 2006). Moreover, less-divided plants of A. anogrammoides are similar to large plants of A. pekinense (the autotetraploid arisen from A. sarelii).On the other hand, the name Asplenium anogrammoides has been misapplied (e.g., Komarov, Izv. Imp. S.-Peterburgsk. Bot. Sada 16: 145-151. 1916; Komarov & Klobukova-Alisova, Opred. Rast. Dalnevost. Kraia 1: 82. 1931; Fomin, Fl. Sibir. Orient. Extremi 5: 152-154. 1930; in Komarov & Iljin, Fl. URSS 1: 68. 1934; Ching, loc. cit.: 37. 1958) to S Siberian and Mongolian A. tenuicaule var. subvarians.Yellow-brown (root)hairs are present on the rhizome, stipe base, and scale base of Asplenium altajense, A. anogrammoides, A. pekinense, A. sarelii, A. tenuicaule, and other related taxa, and thus cannot be used to distinguish them. The average exospore and stomata length are the most reliable characters discriminating between diploid and tetraploids in this complex. Asplenium anogrammoides can often be separated from A. pekinense by its largely not-reduced lamina base and its ovate-triangular (vs. deltoid) pinnae with stalks 2-4 mm (vs. 0.5-2 mm).Where Asplenium anogrammoides grows together with A. tenuicaule, their sterile triploid hybrid, A. ×mitsutae, is common. Asplenium ×mitsutae Viane & Reichstein, nothosp. nov. Type: China. Sichuan: Qingcheng Shan, ca. 70 km WNW of Chengdu, mixed evergreen forest with Rhododendron, on wall inside temple yard together with A. anogrammoides and A. tenuicaule, 1050 m, 16 Sep 1988, Viane 4046-B (= TR-7177) (holotype, GENT). Planta hybrida, inter parentes A. anogrammoides et A. tenuicaule quoad divisionem laminae atque pinnularum segmentorumque formam necnon dimensiones cellularum accessoriarum stomatum intermedia, ab eis sporis abortivis necnon chromosomatum numero triploideo (2n = 108, meiose bivalentibus univalentibusque 36) differt. Meiotic chromosome behavior in this hybrid shows that A. anogrammoides contains one chromosome set of A. tenuicaule. This hybrid is named after S. Mitsuta, who collected it for us in Japan with several other living plants in 1985. Asplenium sarelii var. magnum H. S. Kung, described from Sichuan, is probably the same hybrid combination."Asplenium wudangense" (Z. R. Wang & X. Hou, Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 4. 2003) belongs here but was not validly published because no Latin description or diagnosis, or reference to such, was provided (Melbourne Code, Art. 39.1).

Asplenium antrophyoides var. grossidentatum Bonaparte ex Tardieu (Asplén. Tonkin, 25. 1932; Neottopteris antrophyoides var. cristata Ching & S. H. Wu) is an aberrant monstrosity with a lacerate frond, known from Vietnam and SE Yunnan. Another form with a very wide frond base and described as Neottopteris latipes by Ching is also treated as a synonym; the perispores are similar (Wei & Dong, Nordic J. Bot. 30: 90-103. 2012).

Asplenium asterolepis is similar, and perhaps conspecific, to A. crinicaule but has smaller, more oblong pinnae. Its scales are deltoid-tridentate with a very long central apical tail, as those of A. crinicaule. At present, this taxon seems to be known only from the type collection and may represent just a local variant of A. crinicaule.

Plants of Asplenium austrochinense from Guangdong are octoploid like the Japanese (Shimura & Takiguchi, J. Jap. Bot. 54: 311-318. 1979), and scales are similar in Chinese and Japanese specimens. Upon drought stress, the margins of the frond tend to roll inward, protecting the abaxial epidermis with the stomata. The name A. consimile Ching was used to describe plants with a somewhat thinner lamina.

Asplenium bullatum was confused with A. bulbiferum G. Forster by, e.g., Hooker (Sp. Fil. 3: 196. 1860) p.p., Beddome (Ferns Brit. India 1: 65. 1865; Handb. Ferns Brit. India, 159. 1883), Clarke (Trans. Linn. Soc. London, Bot. 1: 485. 1880), Christensen (Index Filic. 103. 1905) p.p., Panigrahi (Bull. Bot. Surv. India 2: 313. 1960), and Ching and Wu (Fl. Xizang. 1: 184. 1983).Plants of Asplenium bullatum from Nepal are octoploid (Matsumoto & Nakaike in Watanabe & Malla, Cryptog. Himalayas 1: 179. 1988), unlike the tetraploids known from the E Himalaya (Bir, Curr. Sci. 29: 446. 1960). Further studies are needed to find out possible correlations with the dissection of the lamina, which varies from 2-pinnate to 4-pinnatifid, and with the more divided forms considered typical and recognized as A. bullatum var. bullatum (大盖铁角蕨(原变种) da gai tie jiao jue (yua bian zhong)). Bipinnate forms have been called A. bullatum var. shikokianum (Makino) Ching & S. H. Wu (FRPS 4(2): 75. 1999; 稀羽铁角蕨 xi yu tie jiao jue). However, A. ×shikokianum Makino (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 13: 13. 1899, pro sp., described from Japan) is the name for the natural hexaploid (Shimura & Matsumoto, J. Jap. Bot. 51: 235-244. 1976) hybrid between A. wrightii and A. ritoense and should not be used to describe the less-divided forms of A. bullatum (e.g., H. S. Kung, Fl. Sichuan. 6: 381. 1988; Wu, FRPS 4(2): 75. 1999; P. S. Wang & X. Y. Wang, Pterid. Fl. Guizhou, 139. 2001, p.p.; Li, Fl. Hunan 1: 288. 2004, p.p.). Many specimens currently filed in Chinese herbaria as A. shikokianum or as A. bullatum var. shikokianum have good spores and are not hybrids. True A. ×shikokianum is not uncommon where its parents grow together (e.g., Guizhou, Taiwan). Asplenium ×wangii C. M. Kuo (Bot. Bull. Acad. Sin. 29: 109-111. 1988), the hybrid between A. bullatum and A. wrightii, is morphologically similar to A. ×shikokianum and could be confused. Asplenium ×wangii was described from Taiwan and may be present where the parent taxa grow together (Fujian, Guizhou, Hunan, Sichuan, Taiwan, and Yunnan).

Asplenium capillipes is the smallest species of the genus in China and may be overlooked since it often grows hidden among moss. It is reported from Gansu (Tianshui), Hunan, and Shaanxi (Tibia Shan), but we have seen no specimens; however, it should be noted that large plants of this species are similar to small plants of A. tenuicaule and may be confused with it. Identification of vouchers from Bhutan (Itô in H. Hara, Fl. E. Himalaya, 486-489. 1966) needs verification since some belong to A. fugax, which has a flagelliform apex in contrast to A. capillipes. Plants growing in thick moss cushions may have stipes up to 9 cm. Asplenium capillipes is diploid with n = 36II during meiosis (Mitui, J. Jap. Bot. 45: 84-90. 1970) and 2n = 72 chromosomes in vegetative cells. It is remarkable that it has only 32 relatively large spores per sporangium.

We consider Asplenium castaneoviride to be a good species, not a sterile hybrid (Ching & Iwatsuki, J. Jap. Bot. 57: 129-132. 1982) because Lovis et al. (Brit. Fern Gaz. 10: 263-268. 1972) and Lin and Sleep (in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 111-127. 1989) have shown that this is a fertile allotetraploid, which originated via chromosome doubling in the sterile hybrid between A. ruprechtii and A. incisum.

Asplenium caucasicum is the diploid ancestor of the more common autotetraploid A. septentrionale (see below). This taxon is best known from the Caucasus region, but microcharacters have shown its presence in Xinjiang. A recent chromosome count from Xizang confirms its presence in China. A doubling of its genome has led to the origin of autotetraploid A. septentrionale. In places where both taxa grow together, their triploid sterile hybrid, A. ×dirense Viane & Reichstein, can be expected.Asplenium sasakii (Hayata) Makino & Nemoto was distinguished from A. septentrionale by its narrower fronds (a.o., Tagawa, Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 10: 204-205. 1941); it may be an earlier name for A. caucasicum if Taiwanese plants turn out to be diploid. However, at present, no chromosome counts or flow-cytometric data are available for Taiwanese plants.

Asplenium ceterach is widely distributed in S Europe and was often put into the separate genus Ceterach Willdenow (Anleit. Selbststud. Bot. 578. 1804, nom. cons.; 药蕨属 yao jue shu) on the basis of its peculiar pinnatipartite fronds, submarginally anastomosing veins, and the dense, abaxial scale covering. However, all these characters also occur in other clades within the family, and molecular studies (Van den heede et al., Amer. J. Bot. 90: 481-495. 2003) have shown that "Ceterach" consists of two separate clades both nested within Aspleniaceae and not meriting generic status. This species is autotetraploid; its diploid ancestor (A. javorkeanum Vida), from which it can be distinguished by its larger spores, is only known from the Mediterranean area.

Asplenium coenobiale has a variable frond division probably depending on growing conditions with large and more divided plants often growing on rocks in forests. Plants are tetraploid but often produce some aborted spores. Further study will have to show whether they are sexual or agamosporous. In Chinese literature, this name has often been misapplied to the next species (A. pulcherrimum). Due to this confusion, its distribution is not well known.

At present, octoploids are known from S India (Kuriachan, Cytologia 32: 500-506. 1968), Sichuan (Wang in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 133-134. 1989), Guangdong, and Guizhou, and dodecaploids from Guizhou and Guangdong.Plants are variable in frond and pinna shape, even at the type locality at Dinghu Shan, Guangdong, where the species is dodecaploid. Members of this aggregate are similar to Asplenium pellucidum Lamarck, which is octoploid in Réunion, but has more narrow pinnae with an acuminate apex and many strongly reduced basal pinnae. Asplenium horridum Kaulfuss has similar scales. We prefer to treat this taxon as an aggregate species until the ploidy of plants at the different type localities is better known.The name Asplenium adiantoides (here treated as a synonym of A. aethiopicum) was misapplied to this species by Y. C. Wu et al. (Bull. Dept. Biol. Sun Yatsen Univ. 3: t. 88-89. 1932).

On rocks; 1000-3000 m. ?Xizang [Afghanistan, India, Kashmir, Nepal, Pakistan; isolated populations in Africa, North America (Mexico, United States)].

Asplenium dalhousiae is a relatively common W Himalayan fern expected to occur in Xizang as it has been reported for Nepal (Roy et al., Brit. Fern Gaz. 10: 194. 1971); it is recorded provisionally in the Flora. This and the following three taxa (A. paucivenosum, A. magnificum, A. qiujiangense) were often included in the genus Ceterachopsis (J. Smith) Ching (Bull. Fan Mem. Inst. Biol., Bot. 10: 8. 1940; 苍山蕨 属 cang shan jue shu) on the basis of their peculiar frond morphology. The group consists of four or five species, mainly from the subtropical mountains of SW China, and one (A. dalhousiae) more widely distributed taxon. Recent studies have confirmed that this clade does not merit generic rank.

Based on its peculiar morphology and scolopendrioid sori, Asplenium delavayi has been placed in various satellite genera; these have now been abandoned because modern studies show them all nested within Asplenium. See Mickel (Brittonia 28: 326-328. 1976) for a discussion on the differences with supposedly related groups.

In rock crevices (often dolomite); 1500-3300 m. Hebei, Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan [Afghanistan, Mongolia, Russia (E Siberia); SW Asia (Iran, Turkey), S Europe].

Contrary to previous reports, new and more extensive research in S Europe has shown that there are no gross morphological differences between Asplenium dolomiticum and A. ruta-muraria (see below). Asplenium deqenense and A. suborbiculare, both with an average exospore length of 39-40 µm, are considered juvenile, depauperate forms of A. dolomiticum. Small juvenile forms with simple or ternate fronds are not rare in populations of both A. ruta-muraria and A. dolomiticum.

Plants of Asplenium ensiforme with extremely narrow fronds, occurring at higher elevations, have sometimes been recognized as a separate species, variety, or form. A specimen from Taiwan with forked frond apices was described as "A. bicuspe" (nom. nud., cited in the protologue of Diplazium bicuspe), and we have seen such aberrant forked forms also from Yunnan. Forked fronds occur in all species of pteridophytes, often randomly in particular plants, and do not merit taxonomic status.Plants from India were reported to be tetraploid (n = 72) by Mehra and Bir (Curr. Sci. 26: 151-152. 1957) and by Bir (Curr. Sci. 29: 445-447. 1960; Curr. Sci. 31: 248-250. 1962; Caryologia 18: 107-115. 1965). This species is similar to Asplenium holosorum; for differences, see below that species.

Large specimens of Asplenium exiguum are similar to well-developed plants of A. nesii and can best be distinguished by the presence of gemmae in the apical notch of the pinnae.Asplenium exiguum is an autotetraploid taxon that most probably originated via chromosome doubling in diploid A. lushanense. It is a variable species with an easily overlooked, tiny bud in the sinus at the pinna apex, well illustrated in Ching (Icon. Filic. Sin. 4: pl. 174, 2b. 1937). The morphological variability, both within China and throughout the Himalaya, is relatively large, though mainly restricted to size differences. Growing conditions may strongly influence frond length and the shape of pinnae (from almost oblong to triangular). In some populations (S India, China, Philippines), the rachis is flagelliform and terminates in a slender tail with a terminal budlet. This variation led to much confusion and the description of several (local) species, e.g., A. glenniei, A. loherianum, A. moupinense, A. woodsioides, and A. yunnanense. Asplenium moupinense var. dareiforme represents a luxurious, well-developed plant that does not differ in any essential character from other members of this group. Since there are no fundamental morphological, nor cytological, differences between these taxa, we treat them as synonyms of tetraploid A. exiguum following Hope (Bull. Torrey Bot. Club 26: 58-62. 1899; J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 13: 657-671. 1901), Ching (Icon. Filic. Sin. 4: pl. 174. 1937), Maxon (Amer. Fern J. 28: 141. 1938), Tagawa (Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 8: 91-100. 1939), Tagawa and Iwatsuki (in Smitinand et al., Fl. Thailand 3(2): 261-291. 1985), and Mickel and Smith (Pterid. Mexico, 94. 2004). The diploid and tetraploid species within this complex can be separated by microcharacters (Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 91-94. 2003): Asplenium lushanense (diploid) with an average exospore length of 24-28 µm and stomata 32-40 µm, and tetraploid A. exiguum with average exospore length of 30-36 µm and stomata 43-52 µm. Where both species grow together (China, Nepal, Vietnam), their sterile triploid hybrid, with aborted spores, an intermediate morphology, and often showing hybrid vigor, is common. Asplenium ×mickelii Viane & Reichstein, nothosp. nov. Type: China. Yunnan: Kunming, Xishan, Longman, ca. 2120 m, on steep limestone cliff, under forest, 29 Sep 1986, Z. R. Wang & M. Chu C806-b1 (=TR-6605-b1) (holotype, PE). Planta hybrida, inter parentes A. exiguum et A. lushanense quoad divisionem laminae atque dimensiones cellularum accessoriarum stomatum intermedia, ab eis sporis abortivis necnon chromosomatum numero triploideo (2n = 108, meiose trivalentibus 0-4, bivalentibus 32-36 et univalentibus 29-36) differt. This hybrid is named after J. Mickel, who collected it in Mexico (Oaxaca: Destrito Ixtlán, 16 Sep 1972, J. T. Mickel & L. Pardue 6488-A [NY]) and sent us living plants for our research on the A. exiguum complex.From their changing concept of this complex, it is not clear if Fraser-Jenkins, Pangtey and Khullars Asplenium exiguum nothosubsp. luyunense Z. R. Wang ex Fraser-Jenkins, Pangtey & Khullar (Indian Fern J. 27(1-2): 198. 2011), a validation at the subspecific level of "A. ×luyunense" (Wang, Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 11. 2003, nom. nud.), also refers to this hybrid.

Specimens of Asplenium formosae with sterile simple fronds are similar to A. scortechinii, but their fronds have an even to repand margin (notched in A. scortechinii) and a more prominent midrib. Asplenium loriceum is a superfluous new name because the epithets "formosae" and "formosanum" should not be regarded as homonyms.Asplenium loriceum var. karapinense (Hayata) Tagawa (Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 2: 200. 1933; "Diplazium makinoi var. karapinense" Hayata, Icon. Pl. Formosan. 5: 272. 1915), described from Taiwan, is sometimes treated as a synonym of this species. The epithet for Asplenium makinoi was taken from "Diplazium makinoi" (Yabe, Enum. Pl. Formosa, 600. 1906), which is a nomen nudum and was not therefore validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)).

Asplenium fugax is easily overlooked as it is a small species hidden in moss cushions under boulders. Plants are often identified or reported as A. capillipes (e.g., Itô in H. Hara, Fl. E. Himalaya, 486-489. 1966; Nakaike, Bull. Natl. Sci. Mus., Tokyo, B, 12: 37-54. 1986), but that taxon never has a flagelliform apex. Christ (Bull. Soc. Bot. France 52(Mém. 1): 1-69. 1905) cited two syntypes: one collection by Delavay and another by Farges, both kept in Paris (P). Delavays gathering is a mixture mounted on three separate sheets numbered 1, 2, and 3. Most plants fit Christs description and belong to A. fugax, but there is also a Woodsia specimen on sheet 2. Plant "7" on sheet 1 (bearing Delavays original label) is well pressed, the most fertile and best developed, and it is selected here as lectotype. The other syntype (Sichuan [Chongqing], Tchen-kéou-tin, 2000 m, August, Farges 657 [P!]) belongs to A. capillipes.

Plants from Sikkim, India, were reported to be diploid hybrids by Bir (Curr. Sci. 29: 445-447. 1960) and by Mehra (Res. Bull. Panjab Univ. Sci., n.s., 12: 139-164. 1961), but our recent FCM results show that at least the Guizhou plants are polyploids (12-14x).In its present circumscription this species includes different taxa that need further study. Asplenium ×xinyiense Ching & S. H. Wu (Bull. Bot. Res., Harbin 9(2): 82. 1989, pro sp.), a plant with abortive spores described from SW Guangdong, is a hybrid between either A. griffithianum or A. loxogrammoides and A. wrightii. These species grow intermixed on cliffs near the type locality of A. ×xinyiense.

The name Asplenium laciniatum D. Don (Tarachia laciniata (D. Don) C. Presl) has been widely and persistently misapplied to this species; see the comment under A. varians (species no. 77).Fronds of Asplenium gueinzianum are similar to those of A. indicum and A. yoshinagae, as well as to those of the A. varians complex, but have costate scales with hyaline borders and small buds or plantlets on the frond surface near the pinna apex (not on the rachis as in A. indicum/yoshinagae).

Asplenium holosorum is similar to A. ensiforme but generally grows at lower elevations. Its fronds are more herbaceous and their midrib (rachis) is flat near the apex but raised adaxially in the lower half of the frond and not sulcate. Both species have a similar epidermis structure with cryptopolocytic to basipolocytic (also called anomocytic, staurocytic, or cyclocytic) stomata. In both taxa, the outer free margin of the indusium consists of translucent cells with very thin walls, but this marginal rim is narrow (ca. 2 cell layers) in A. holosorum, but more elaborate and dentate-fimbriate in A. ensiforme.No chromosome counts seem to be available, but our recent FCM results suggest this taxon is probably hexaploid.

Specimens of Asplenium humbertii from Hainan have longer sori than the type, collected in Vietnam. The species is rather similar to A. grevillei Wallich ex Hooker & Greville from India and Thailand, which differs by its smaller scales, distinctly keeled midrib, and areolate-fenestrate perispore (Wei & Dong, Nordic J. Bot. 30: 90-103. 2012). However, the relationship between A. grevillei, A. humbertii, and A. antrophyoides requires further study.

Asplenium indicum is a sexual tetraploid plant in India, the Himalaya (Mehra & Bir, Curr. Sci. 26: 151-152. 1957; Bir, Curr. Sci. 29: 445-447. 1960; Curr. Sci. 31: 248-250. 1962; Caryologia 18: 107-115. 1965), and China (Guizhou, Xizang). It is morphologically very variable and similar to A. yoshinagae with which it is often united to form an aggregate taxon. Because they are genetically isolated and form sterile hybrids when growing together, we treat these taxa as separate species. In China, A. indicum is usually a smaller plant, with smaller spores and stomata than A. yoshinagae, from which it can also be distinguished by a chromosome count or flow-cytometry. The distinction based on the presence of gemmae is highly unreliable, at least in China, where all tetraploids checked were gemmiferous. The gemmae are formed on the pinna stalks, close to the rachis, rarely on the rachis itself. Another very similar taxon, A. gueinzianum, is also gemmiferous but produces buds on the surface of the pinnae. Due to confusion among these taxa, the exact distribution of this species is not well documented.

Asplenium kansuense is a putative autotetraploid, which probably originated via chromosome doubling in A. tenuicaule var. tenuicaule. Its general morphology and perispore are very similar to those of that taxon, but its spore size indicates that it is probably tetraploid. No chromosome counts are available. In China, A. kansuense was often misidentified as A. varians or as A. sarelii s.l. Large tripinnate plants resemble tetraploid A. anogrammoides with which they share half of their genome.The S Indian (Nilgiri) plants belonging to this species (Asplenium fimbriatum var. leptophyllum) occur at higher elevations, are smaller than the Chinese plants, and are similar to both A. varians and A. semivarians. Several chromosome reports of S Indian "tetraploid Asplenium varians" may refer to this species. Large specimens of African A. fimbriatum Kunze are closely similar, also in perispore characters. Hybridization experiments have shown that true A. fimbriatum is an allotetraploid with the same genome composition as A. varians and is thus best considered a variety of the latter (Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003): Asplenium varians Wallich ex Hooker & Greville var. fimbriatum (Kunze) Viane stat. nov. (Basionym: Asplenium fimbriatum Kunze, Linnaea 18: 117. 1844; A. varians subsp. fimbriatum (Kunze) Schelpe).

Asplenium kiangsuense is similar to a small form of A. normale but differs in its scales with wider central band of occluded cells, the adaxially flat rachis, the green rachis tip, the smaller and more elliptic pinnae, and the perispore. The green rachis tip and the pinna shape make it also similar to A. adulterinum Milde, from which it differs in the blacker and wider zone of occluded cell lumina of its scales. Due to confusion with A. normale, the distribution of this taxon is not well known.

Due to the peculiar frond shape and double sori facing each other, both Asplenium komarovii and A. scolopendrium were often placed in the former satellite genus Phyllitis. Modern studies confirm that it deserves no recognition. The group consists of two species: a diploid ancestral taxon (2n = 72) essentially in Europe and an autotetraploid in North America (including Mexico) and NE Asia (Mitui, J. Jap. Bot. 41: 60-64. 1966; Sci. Rep. Tokyo Kyoiku Daigaku, B, 13: 285-333. 1968).Asplenium komarovii originated by chromosome doubling in diploid A. scolopendrium; in local floras it is usually mentioned under this latter name. In the absence of a chromosome count or flow cytometric data, it can best be distinguished from its ancestor by its larger mean exospore length (more than 31 µm).

Asplenium kukkonenii is most similar to A. tenuicaule and A. varians. Crossing experiments and micromorphology have shown that A. tenuicaule is one of its ancestors (Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003). The second ancestor of A. kukkonenii is still unknown. The fact that A. kukkonenii and A. varians share a genome explains why these taxa are difficult to differentiate from each other. The lamina of A. kukkonenii is usually slightly narrower and more acuminate (occasionally even caudate) at the apex. The mean length of the rhizome scales is usually less than 3.5 mm in A. kukkonenii and more than 3.5 mm in A. varians. Reliable differentiation is also possible by examination of epidermal cells, which are thickened or pseudomamillate in their sinuses in A. kukkonenii, but not so in A. varians. In herbaria, A. kukkonenii is often identified as A. varians or as A. fontanum and was included in A. varians by, e.g., Beddome (Handb. Ferns Brit. India, 158. 1883), Hope (J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 13: 667. 1901), Stewart (Biologia 3: 133-164. 1957), Stewart in Nasir & Ali (Fl. W. Pakistan, 18. 1972), Nakaike and Malik Cryptog. Fl. Pakistan) 1: 270. 1992; Cryptog. Fl. Pakistan 2: 332. 1993), and G. F. Zhang (Fl. Yunnan. 20: 673. 2006).

Asplenium lepturus is similar to A. polyodon but has more narrow and caudate pinnae, a widely creeping rhizome, and a peculiar perispore pattern. It shares these characters with a number of tropical taxa, e.g., A. contiguum Kaulfuss from Hawaii, the neotropical A. serra Langsdorff & Fisher, the African A. friesiorum C. Christensen group, and A. nitens Swartz from Réunion.

● Rock crevices; 400-1800 m. Liaoning, Nei Mongol (Da Xingan Ling), Shanxi.

This species is named after Professor Yu-Quan Ma, principal editor of Flora Intramongolica.Asplenium mae is mainly known from the Da Xingan Ling. It is a putative autotetraploid which probably originated via chromosome doubling in A. tenuicaule var. subvarians, which it strongly resembles. Average spore size indicates that it is probably tetraploid, but no chromosome counts are yet available. In herbaria, A. mae is either filed under A. tenuicaule, A. subvarians, A. anogrammoides, or A. sarelii.Several names have been misapplied to this species, e.g., Asplenium subvarians by Ling et al. (in Liu, Fl. Shanxi. 1: 84-97. 1992), A. tenuicaule by Wu and Bai (Fl. Intramongol. 1: 49-117. 1985), and A. sarelii by Li and Wang (Fl. Liaoning 1: 73-79. 1988).

● Epiphytic or on rocks in forests; 400-700 m. Probably endemic to Taiwan.

This rare species was confused with Asplenium vulcanicum Blume in De Vol and Kuo (Fl. Taiwan 1: 491. 1975). More recently, A. matsumurae was treated as a synonym of S Indian A. serricula Fée (Kuo, Taiwania 30: 37. 1985; Shieh et al., Fl. Taiwan, ed. 2, 1: 461. 1994; Knapp, Ferns Fern Allies Taiwan, 48, 55. 2011), but that species has a more creeping rhizome, fewer pinnae, and a terminal pinna perfectly conform with the lateral ones. Asplenium matsumurae is also superficially similar to members of the A. wrightii complex, but it differs in its venation pattern with the first basal basiscopic vein lacking and more distal veins simple (not forked), its terminal pinna relatively similar to the subapical lateral pinnae, and its indusia not rolling back at maturity.

● On rocks in forests; ca. 2000 m. Yunnan.

Asplenium microtum is similar to A. trichomanes and A. quadrivalens but clearly differs by the fingerlike papillae bordering the wings on the rachis. A similar wing structure is also found in A. glanduliserrulatum and A. humistratum, from which it differs by its gemmiferous rachis. However, not all plants have gemmae, and these species are kept separate, pending future research on this complex. The Mexican A. hallbergii Mickel & Beitel, which has a similar rachis but with papillae more perpendicular to the wing, is perhaps distantly related.

Asplenium neovarians, known from few collections, needs more study. Based on the length of its stomata and exospore, it should at least be tetraploid. It is similar to A. altajense (but different in its more distinct apical pinna), A. aitchisonii (but different in its putative ploidy level), and A. kukkonenii, and from all of which it differs in perispore morphology.

Asplenium nesii is similar to larger forms of A. exiguum, but its pinna apices are without gemmae, the stipe is green toward the rachis, and the rachis itself is usually entirely green. Asplenium barkamense is a luxurious form from Sichuan, but locally not rare in Xizang. Type specimens of A. ×mainlingense Ching & S. K. Wu (Fl. Xizang 1: 184. 1983, pro sp.) are hybrids with aborted spores. They probably represent a cross between A. nesii and A. varians or A. tenuicaule, which all occur in the area close to the type locality near Mainling, Xizang.

Clustered on tree trunks or rocks in rain forests; 100-1900 m. ?Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Taiwan, Xizang, Yunnan [Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Vietnam; tropical regions of E Africa and Australia, Pacific islands (Polynesia)].

Asplenium nidus is accepted here in a broad sense and constitutes a species complex (e.g., Murakami et al. in M. Kato, Biol. Biodivers. 53-66. 1999; Yatabe et al., Amer. J. Bot. 88: 1517-1522. 2001). The variability of its frond and perispore morphology (e.g., Wei & Dong, Nordic J. Bot. 30: 90-103. 2012), as well as other phenetic characters, is not well studied in relation to its molecular diversity.Asplenium setoi N. Murakami & Serizawa, recently described from Japan, might be present at low elevations in China (Taiwan); typical specimens can be distinguished from A. nidus by their keeled to boat-shaped midrib. Another species regularly confused with both A. setoi and A. nidus is the often cultivated A. australasicum (J. Smith) Hooker, a South Pacific taxon.Based on their particular venation pattern, taxa resembling Asplenium nidus have been recognized as a separate section (A. sect. Thamnopteris Hooker & Baker), a subgenus (A. subg. Thamnopteris C. Presl), or as a genus of its own (Neottopteris J. Smith; syn. Thamnopteris (C. Presl) C. Presl). Plants are often epiphytes with large simple fronds growing in a close spiral and forming the typical birds nest. Veins departing from the midrib (rachis) fork anadromously, run almost parallel and straight to the margin where they connect to a common submarginal vein. However, recent molecular studies do not support the separation of this group as a separate genus. The clade consists of 15-30 species, and modern research shows that more taxa may await description. A critical revision of the group is urgently needed. Members occur mainly in rain forests of tropical Asia and the Pacific. A few taxa are widely cultivated as house plants and sold as "birds-nest fern." Many plants in commerce belong to A. australasicum, which can be distinguished from true A. nidus by its abaxially dark brown carinate midrib.

In this Asplenium normale aggregate, three distinct taxa have been distinguished on the basis of the presence or absence of one to several buds on the rachis. At the tip of many fronds of typical A. normale sits a single gemma, often developed into a small plant. Plants without such buds have been described as A. normale var. boreale or A. boreale, though the oldest name for non-gemmiferous plants would probably have to be A. minus (PRC!). The name A. shimurae, or A. normale var. shimurae, is used for plants with many gemmae per frond. Sterile hybrids between these taxa are known from Japan, and their flavonoid patterns are different. All three morphotypes occur in China (A. shimurae mainly in Yunnan), next to intermediate hybrids.In this aggregate, diploid (China (Taiwan), S India, Malaysia, Nepal) and tetraploid chromosome numbers have been reported. Though Bir (Curr. Sci. 29: 446. 1960) and Nakaike (Bull. Natl. Sci. Mus., Tokyo, B, 12: 37-54. 1986) mainly reported tetraploids for the E Himalaya, and Wang (in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 133-134. 1989) for China, we found tetraploid, hexaploid, and octoploid plants, next to hybrids with intermediate ploidy.Most of the typical gemmiferous plants of Asplenium normale are tetraploid, have scales with a central line of cells with more thickened and darker walls than the more marginal cells, have a deep furrow flanked by relatively broad and rounded edges at the adaxial side of the rachis, and lack the first basiscopic vein departing from the costa. Such tetraploid plants, as well as type material of A. multijugum from Nepal, have an average exospore length of 26-30 µm. The absence of a basiscopic vein is a character A. normale shares with Hymenasplenium, in which two or more such veins are lacking.Several morphologically similar plants have scales with the lumina of the central cells occluded and opaque (costate-opaque scales as in e.g., Asplenium trichomanes and A. kiangsuense), a shallow furrow or a flat rachis bordered by a narrow sharp rim (as in A. kiangsuense, not a wing as in A. trichomanes), and usually possess the first basiscopic vein on the costa. Sterile morphologically intermediates between these plants and true A. normale are known from Guangdong. Because no clear correlations were found between the different ploidy levels (4x, 6x, 8x) and the morphotypes called A. normale, A. boreale, and A. shimurae, we refrain from recognizing them as species.

Asplenium oblanceolatum is similar to other members of the A. nidus complex but differs from all by its echinate perispores (Holttum, Gard. Bull. Singapore 27: 143-154. 1974; Y. L. Zhang et al., Sporae Pterid. Sin. 240-263. 1976; Wei & Dong, Nordic J. Bot. 30: 90-103. 2012). In addition, it differs from small A. nidus by its midrib structure and from A. phyllitidis and A. antiquum by its narrower scales.We were unable to locate and study the type of Asplenium anguineum Christ (J. Bot. (Morot), ser. 2, 1: 265. 1908) from Vietnam; if this has echinate spores, it would be the oldest name for A. oblanceolatum/A. phyllitidis subsp. malesicum.

Asplenium paucivenosum is a tetraploid species similar to the diploid A. dalhousiae but has much larger spores (and stomata) with a mean exospore length over 40 µm (less than 35 µm in A. dalhousiae) and a different, more fenestrate outer perispore. According to Nakaike (Ferns Nepal 2: 45, 1986), it was confused with A. dalhousiae by Itô (in H. Hara, Fl. E. Himal. 1: 487. 1966; Fl. E. Himal. 2: 214. 1971) and Iwatsuki (in Ohashi, Fl. E. Himal. 3: 194. 1975). It is even more easily confused with A. magnificum which has a larger mean exospore length (48 µm in A. paucivenosum vs. 52 µm in A. magnificum). In critical cases, a chromosome count is needed for identification.

Asplenium pekinense is an autotetraploid (Mitui, J. Jap. Bot. 40: 117-124. 1965; Lin & Sleep in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 111-127. 1989; Wang, Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 1-14. 2003) species arisen by chromosome doubling in diploid A. sarelii. Allotetraploid A. anogrammoides is very similar because true A. sarelii is one of its ancestors, the second being A. tenuicaule (Lin & Sleep, loc. cit.). Reticulate hybridizations between diploid A. tenuicaule, A. sarelii, and A. semivarians led to the evolution of many confusingly similar taxa defying description. These can be grouped into the A. pekinense-complex consisting of A. altajense, A. anogrammoides, A. pekinense, and A. sarelii, and the A. varians group containing A. aitchisonii, A. kukkonenii, A. semivarians, and A. varians. Their close relationship and similarity has led to many wrong identifications, as well as incorrect and unreliable citations. In many places where A. pekinense grows with A. anogrammoides, their sterile tetraploid hybrid is relatively common. Asplenium ×kidoi Sleep ex Viane, Y. X. Lin & Reichstein, nothosp. nov. Type: China. Hebei: ca. 20 km NW of Beijing, Xiangshan park, natural pine forest above Fragrant Hill Hotel, among grasses on shaded hillside with A. anogrammoides, A. pekinense, and Athyrium niponicum (Mettenius) Hance, 190 m, 27 Sep 1997, Viane 7047 (holotype, GENT). Planta hybrida, inter parentes A. anogrammoides et A. pekinense quoad divisionem laminae atque pinnularum segmentorumque formam necnon dimensiones cellularum accessoriarum stomatum intermedia, ab eis sporis abortivis necnon chromosomatum numero tetraploideo (2n = 144, meiose trivalentium bivalentium univalentiumque numeris valde irregularibus) differt. This morphologically intermediate plant often shows hybrid vigor; it was first studied by A. Sleep (a.o., in Lin & Sleep, loc. cit.) who collected it in Japan (Kyushu: Ashi-Kita-cho, 1 Nov 1968, A. Sleep & M. Kido AS/605; BM, PE, TI, Z).Z. R. Wang and K. Q. Wang (Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 8. 2003) reported a hybrid between Asplenium pekinense and A. exiguum (as A. yunnanense), "A. ×jingyunense," and one between A. pekinense and A. varians, "A. ×longmenense," but the two names were not validly published because no Latin description or diagnosis, or reference to such, was provided (Melbourne Code, Art. 39.1).

Asplenium polyodon is a widespread and variable aggregate species that needs more study before it can be split. Tetraploid chromosome numbers were reported from Australia, India (Darjeeling), Malaysia, New Zealand, and Sri Lanka. We found tetraploids and hexaploids in Uganda and China (Guangxi), and decaploids in Réunion and China (Hainan). Plants with broad pinnae have once been identified as A. macrophyllum Swartz (in Schrader, J. Bot. 1800(2): 52. 1801), but the difference between this species and A. polyodon requires further study.

Asplenium prolongatum was confused with A. rutifolium (Bergius) Kunze by Franchet and Savatier (Enum. Pl. Jap. 222. 1876), Makino (Phan. Pter. Jap. Icon. t. 65. 1900), and others, and with A. achilleifolium (Lamarck) C. Christensen by Ogata (Icon. Fil. Jap. 2: t. 55. 1929) and Y. C. Wu et al. (Bull. Dept. Biol. Sun Yatsen Univ. 3: 202. 1932).Though Japanese plants of Asplenium prolongatum were reported to be tetraploid with 2n = 144 (Iwatsuki, Fl. Jap. 1: 103. 1995), all Chinese plants (Guangdong, Guizhou, Hainan) checked by flow cytometry are hexaploid and may have to be ascribed to a new taxon. Asplenium ×kenzoi Kurata, the hybrid with A. wrightii, may also occur in China where its parents often grow together.

Asplenium pseudolaserpitiifolium was often misidentified as A. laserpitiifolium auct. non Lamarck, e.g., by Kunze (Bot. Zeitung (Berlin) 6: 521-526. 1848), Hayata (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 23: 24-34. 1909), Bonaparte (Notes Ptérid. 7: 135-139. 1918), Nakai (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 39: 120. 1925), Tardieu (Asplén. Tonkin, 48. 1932), Ogata (Icon. Fil. Jap. 6: t. 256. 1935), H. Itô (Index Spec. Typic. Herb. Japon. 4. 1959; J. Jap. Bot. 49: 97-104. 1974), Iwatsuki (Ferns Japan, 147. 1992), Iwatsuki et al. (Fl. Japan. 1: 105. 1995); or as A. cuneatum auct. non Lamarck by De Vol and Kuo (Fl. Taiwan 1: 482. 1975).Asplenium pseudolaserpitiifolium belongs to a group of large 3- or 4-pinnate species similar to A. laserpitiifolium Lamarck and revised by Tardieu and Ching (Notul. Syst. (Paris) 5: 134-154. 1936), who described five new Indochinese species. Study of the types shows that characters used to describe or key out their taxa are variable and not diagnostic. Our field studies show that habitat conditions and plant age may strongly influence frond morphology and lamina texture. Frond segments of plants collected after desiccation stress are ± curled inward and have a more narrowly cuneate form instead of their original rhombic shape. In the same paper, A. pseudolaserpitiifolium was described and keyed out as a terrestrial plant, but data on the labels of several paratypes state plants were epiphytic. Flow cytometric analyses show plants are octoploids in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan; no data are available from the literature. Spores of the type specimens of A. neolaserpitiifolium and A. pseudolaserpitiifolium are identical.

Asplenium qiujiangense is similar to A. magnificum but has more falcate and more acute segments, with a gemma at the acroscopic margin at the pinna base. It can also be confused with A. paucivenosum, which has a larger mean exospore length (48 µm in A. paucivenosum vs. 43 µm in A. qiujiangense). In critical cases, a chromosome count will be necessary."Ceterachopsis chiukiangensis Ching & S. H. Fu" and "C. latiloba Ching & K. H. Shing" (in Y. L. Zhang et al., Sporae Pterid. Sin. 256. 1976) are conspecific with Asplenium quijiangense, but the two were not validly published because no Latin description or diagnosis, or reference to such, was provided (Melbourne Code, Art. 39.1).

Tetraploid Asplenium quadrivalens has a broader ecological amplitude, i.e., it is not limited to non-calcareous substrates and has a wider range than A. trichomanes."Asplenium lovisii" (Rothmaler, Wiss. Z. Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Univ. Greifswald, Math.-Naturwiss. Reihe 14(1/2): 77. 1965) belongs here but was not validly published because no type was indicated (Melbourne Code, Art. 40.1); its "type" was a cultivated plant and not a specimen as required by Art. 8.4. If the proposal to conserve the name A. trichomanes with a conserved type, based on a diploid plant according to its traditional ("2x") use and in compliance with Art. 57.1, is not accepted then the name for the current tetraploid species will have to change to A. trichomanes.Asplenium ×heufleri Reichardt (the tetraploid sterile hybrid between A. quadrivalens and A. septentrionale) was recently found in Xinjiang. The authors have not seen any specimens of A. ×alternifolium Wulfen (the triploid sterile hybrid between A. trichomanes and A. septentrionale).

Based on its peculiar morphology and venation pattern, Asplenium ruprechtii has often been put in the satellite genus Camptosorus Link, containing two species (one in Asia, the other in North America). Modern studies have shown that Camptosorus nests within Asplenium and does not form a separate clade.Asplenium ruprechtii is diploid (Kurita, J. Jap. Bot. 40: 234-244. 1965; Mitui, J. Jap. Bot. 40: 117-124. 1965) and hybridizes with tetraploid A. anogrammoides ("A. sarelii" sensu Kurita et auct. Jap., not Hooker) to form the sterile triploid A. ×kitazawae Sa. Kurata. It is also ancestral to the following species.

Asplenium ruta-muraria is an autotetraploid species, very common and widespread in Europe, where it often grows on buildings and walls. It has originated by chromosome doubling in its diploid ancestor A. dolomiticum (see above), from which is genetically isolated, and which has smaller spores and half the number of chromosomes. Their triploid sterile hybrid, A. ×baldense Sleep et al., is usually found where both species grow together. There is considerable variation in frond shape, and size and degree of dissection, best known and mainly described from Europe (e.g., von Heufler, Verh. Zool.-Bot. Vereins Wien 6: 235-354. 1856; Luerssen in Rabenhorst, Krypt.-Fl., 218-228. 1889; Christ, Farnkr. Schweiz, 75-79. 1900; Hedwigia 42: 153-177. 1903; Rosenstock, Allg. Bot. Z.

Asplenium sampsonii is similar to A. thunbergii Kunze (=A. belangeri (Bory) Kunze (1848), not Bory (1833)) from Malaysia and Indonesia, but it is smaller, not gemmiferous on the rachis; the lower pinnae are reduced; and the perispore is different. The distinction between A. sampsonii and A. thunbergii in Chinese floras (e.g., S. H. Wu, FRPS 4(2): 124. 1999; T. L. Wu et al., Fl. Guangdong 7: 190, 203-204. 2006) is based largely on size differences. Manton (in Holttum, Revis. Fl. Malaya 2: 623-627. 1954) found that plants from Malaysia are tetraploid, but since specimens from Hainan and Guangxi are decaploid, we are confident that they are different from true A. thunbergii, which probably does not occur in China. Plants of A. tenerum with bipinnatifid fronds can be similar to this species.

"Asplenium saulii" (Hooker & Baker, Syn. Fil., ed. 2, 216. 1874) is evidently a mere orthographic variant of A. sarelii.Asplenium sarelii is endemic to C China. All reports of this species from outside China are erroneous and usually refer to the very similar tetraploid A. anogrammoides. Hybridization experiments, including cytological study of meiotic behavior in artificially produced hybrids (Lin & Sleep in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 111-127. 1989), and micromorphological study of type material have shown that A. sarelii is one of the parental species of allotetraploid A. anogrammoides; the other parent being diploid A. tenuicaule. These findings were confirmed by cytological and isozyme studies (Wang, Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 1-14. 2003). The morphological similarity between these taxa has led to great confusion, also with true A. pekinense, which is the autotetraploid that originated from true A. sarelii. In A. sarelii, the ultimate segments are less than 1.2 mm wide, the pinnae stalks less than 1 mm wide, and its pinnae are distant from each other and hardly overlap so that the frond silhouette is more open than in A. anogrammoides. Important differential characters are the chromosome number and the average exospore and stomata size. Identification based on morphology alone is very difficult when A. sarelii grows with A. pekinense and A. anogrammoides. At such locations, e.g., Wudang Shan (Hubei) and Huping Shan (Hunan), the sterile triploid hybrids, A. ×wudangshanense (A. pekinense × A. sarelii) and A. ×huawuense (A. anogrammoides × A. sarelii), are relatively common and recognizable by their aborted spores and often undeveloped sporangia. Asplenium ×wudangshanense Viane, Reichstein, Rasbach & Y. X. Lin, nothosp. nov. Type: China. Hubei: Wudang Shan, ca. 2050 m, Sep 1907, Silvestri 6 (pl. 5) (holotype, FI).

Meiotic chromosome behavior in A. ×wudangshanense confirms that A. pekinense is the autotetraploid of A. sarelii. Meiotic chromosome behavior (Wang in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 133-134. 1989; loc. cit. 2003) in A. ×huawuense confirms that A. anogrammoides is allotetraploid and contains one chromosome set of A. sarelii. Asplenium ×huawuense Z. R. Wang ex Viane & Y. X. Lin, nothosp. nov. Type: China. Hubei, Wudang Shan, ca. 850 m, 18 Jul 1987, Z. R. Wang C843 (holotype, PE).

Asplenium saxicola is an aggregate of tetraploid and octoploid plants with fronds similar, though more divided at the base, to those of A. dimidiatum Swartz (America) and A. hemitomum Hieronymus and A. megalura Hieronymus (Africa). The scales are similar to those of A. aethiopicum but have thicker cell walls and a shorter apical tail. The ploidy level of plants from the type locality in Guizhou is not known. Tetraploids were found in Guangxi and octoploids in Guangxi and in Yunnan.

Typical Asplenium scortechinii plants have narrow fronds, but intermediates with A. griffithianum exist. Plants from the Malay Peninsula were found to be tetraploid (n = ca. 72) by Manton (in Holttum, Revis. Fl. Malaya 2: 625. 1954), but our recent FCM results show that, at least in China, this taxon is an aggregate of hexaploid (Hainan) and dodecaploid (Yunnan) species. In particular, the relationships with dodecaploid A. griffithianum needs further investigation.

The range of Asplenium semivarians is not well known due to confusion with similar species of the A. varians complex. It may also occur in Malaysia (Johore), but the single specimen, cited by Morton under A. varians, needs further study. Experimental hybridization and micromorphology have shown (Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003) that it is different from diploid A. tenuicaule and that it is an ancestor of true A. varians. Asplenium semivarians is known from S India as diploid A. varians (e.g., Manickam & Irudayaraj, Cytol. Ferns W. Ghats, 38, 71. 1988; Pterid. Fl. Nilgiris, 130-131. 2003) or as diploid A. laciniatum (Bir & Irudayaraj, Fern Gaz. 16: 186-187. 2001). Luxurious plants become almost tripinnate. This species can be distinguished from similar taxa by its diploid chromosome number, its alate perispore with the middle perispore lacking in the areoles (zones between the ridges), and the smaller exospore and guard cells.

Asplenium septentrionale is the autotetraploid that originated by chromosome doubling in its diploid ancestor A. caucasicum. In the absence of a chromosome count, it can best be distinguished by its larger mean exospore length (more than 37 µm) and its broader lamina.Asplenium septentrionale often hybridizes with other Asplenium species in Europe wherever they co-occur; one of these, A. ×heufleri Reichardt (A. septentrionale × A. quadrivalens), was recently found in Xinjiang.

Asplenium tenerum is a variable taxon. Plants with gemmiferous rachis are known from China (Taiwan), Indonesia, Japan (Ryukyu Islands), and Malaysia and may represent a different taxon. As presently circumscribed, this species is probably an aggregate needing further monographic study. Plants with pinnate-pinnatisect fronds, similar to A. sampsonii but without reduced basal pinnae, most probably belong to this species. Indian plants are tetraploid, but the chromosome number of Chinese material is unknown.

Asplenium tenuicaule is an ancestral diploid species involved in a reticulate pattern of relationships unraveled in the 1980s-1990s (Sleep & Reichstein, Candollea 39: 675-691. 1984; Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003) by micromorphological studies and cytological research in China (Y. X. Lin, Z. R. Wang), England (A. Sleep), Germany (H. Rasbach), and Switzerland (T. Reichstein, R. Viane). This reticulate evolution, with its inherent general morphological fuzziness, has led to much misunderstanding and confusion. Asplenium tenuicaule is parental to the following taxa with which it can easily be confused: A. kansuense, A. varians, A. altajense, A. anogrammoides, A. mae, and A. kukkonenii. The name A. varians auct. non Wallich ex Hooker was often used for, or included in, this taxon (e.g., Franchet & Savatier, Enum. Pl. Jap. 220-221. 1877; Beddome, Handb. Ferns Brit. India, 158. 1883; Hillebrand, Fl. Hawaiian Isl. 591. 1888; Hope, J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 13: 657-671. 1901; Mori, Enum. Pl. Corea, 4. 1922; Ogata, Icon. Fil. Jap. 1: t. 10. 1928; Tardieu, Asplén.

Himalaya, 3rd report, 195. 1975; Mitui, Bull. Nippon Dental Coll., Gen. Educ. 4: 221-271. 1975; Nakaike, Enum. Pterid. Jap. 111. 1975; De Vol & Kuo in Li et al., Fl. Taiwan 1: 490. 1975; Kurata & Nakaike, Illustr. Pterid. Japan 2: 226-227. 1981; Ling et al. in Liu et al., Fl. Taiyuan. 41. 1990; in Liu, Fl. Shanxi. 1: 91. 1992; Nakaike & Malik, Cryptog. Fl. Pakistan 1: 270. 1992; Cryptog. Fl. Pakistan 2: 332. 1993). During sporogenesis, plants of this species may produce relatively high numbers of diplospores (a spore containing a double set of chromosomes), which may have played a role in the production of polyploid offspring, e.g., Asplenium kansuense, A. mae (see below).In places where Asplenium tenuicaule and A. varians grow together, their sterile hybrid is not uncommon.This is a widespread and variable species ranging from the E African highlands (rare) via the Himalaya to S (Altai) and SE Siberia, Korea, China, Japan, and Hawaii. It can be divided into three varieties, with overlapping ranges in China and Japan. Few but fertile intermediates have been found. Hybridization experiments have shown that the varieties are genetically very similar (Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003). Kuo (Taiwania 30: 5-100. 1985) was probably the first to apply the name correctly.

"Asplenium concinnum" (Wallich, Numer. List, no. 216. 1829) belongs here but is a nomen nudum and was not therefore validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)).Asplenium tenuifolium is common in the Himalaya. It is probably an aggregate of diploid plants with 2n = 72 chromosomes (reported from India; Bir, Curr. Sci. 29: 445-447. 1960; Caryologia 18: 107-115. 1965) and tetraploids (specimens from Guangxi and Guangdong). More studies are needed. Most plants have small dormant buds (one or more) on the adaxial side of the costa (near the first acroscopic costule or more distal) or on the costules. It is often fertile when still young (var. minor S. H. Wu) and can then be confused with A. capillipes (gemmae in axil between costa and rachis) or with A. tenuicaule (without gemmae). The presence and position of its gemmae are diagnostic. We agree with Tagawa (Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 8: 91-100. 1939) that there are no significant differences between A. tenuissimum and A. tenuifolium.

Fronds approximate, subcaespitose; stipe dull grayish brown to stramineous, 15-25(-35) cm, with scales similar to those on rhizome; lamina narrowly triangular-ovate, 35-40(-45) × (10-)13-22 cm, 1-pinnate, apex triangular and pinnatifid, acute to acuminate; pinnae 12-20 pairs, subopposite, shortly stalked (2-3 mm), basal pinnae only slightly reduced, largest pinnae (8-)10-14 × 1.5-3 cm, narrowly trapeziform-trullate and slightly falcate, base asymmetrical, acroscopic side truncate and often auriculate, basiscopic side narrowly cuneate, margin irregularly crenate-sinuate to crenate-serrate, apex acute-acuminate. Costa slightly sinuous, raised abaxially, adaxially with 2 ridges and sulcate; veins slender, 2- or 3-forked. Fronds firmly herbaceous, glaucous to yellowish brown-green or grayish green when dry, abaxially with minute, brown, hairlike scales; rachis grayish green to stramineous, with sparse scales, narrowly winged below apex, often gemmiferous below terminal segment. Sori linear, (0.8-)1-2 cm, usually on acroscopic vein, at an angle of 10°-25° with costa; indusia grayish brown, linear, membranous, margin with thin hyaline cells, entire, usually opening toward costa, rolling back and erose but persistent.

Asplenium trapezoideum is a rare species, superficially similar to the more common A. wrightii, but it has a different rachis and costa structure and is often proliferous near the apex. Flow cytometry of plants from Myanmar show these are probably octoploid. Asplenium trapezoideum is closely similar and shares its perispore pattern with the NE Indian A. khasianum Sledge, which may even be conspecific.Asplenium subtrapezoideum, distinguished on size differences, is put into synonymy because fertile intermediate plants exist.

Asplenium trichomanes is often circumscribed as a collective species consisting of various cytotypes (six taxa are known from C and S Europe). These taxa, for convenience often recognized at the subspecific level, are reproductively isolated (producing sterile hybrids when growing together) and are treated as species in this flora. The species can be distinguished by microcharacters, by flow cytometry, by counting chromosomes, and by their edaphic preference. When the complex is subdivided into species or subspecies, the diploid silicolous taxon has been designated (since Lovis, Brit. Fern Gaz. 9: 147-160. 1964) as A. trichomanes s.s. or as subsp. trichomanes; the common tetraploid as A. quadrivalens or as A. trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens D. E. Meyer. A lectotype was selected in this sense by Viane (in Jonsell & Jarvis, Nordic J. Bot. 14: 145-164. 1994), but as a result of the Linnean typification project this selection was overruled by Grubovs (Novosti Sist. Vyssh. Rast. 21: 5-21. 1984), who "selected" the tetraploid specimen in the Linnaean Herbarium at LINN as type without any argument or fundamental study. However, pending a proposal to conserve the name A. trichomanes with a conserved type, based on a diploid plant, we continue to use the name A. trichomanes s.s. in its traditional ("2x") sense in compliance with Art. 57.1 of the Melbourne Code. However, if such a proposal is not accepted, the correct specific name for the current diploid species will not only have to change to A. melanocaulon Willdenow, but the name A. trichomanes will have to be given to the following tetraploid taxon, A. quadrivalens.Asplenium ×lusaticum D. E. Meyer (the sterile hybrid between A. trichomanes and A. quadrivalens) is not rare where both parents grow together. It can be easily recognized by its aborted spores. In China, this hybrid is cytologically confirmed for Sichuan ("Longchi").

As presently circumscribed, Asplenium tripteropus is an aggregate of a diploid and a tetraploid species (2n = 72 or 144) both in China and in Japan (Mitui, J. Jap. Bot. 40: 117-124. 1965; Tatuno & Kawakami, Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 82: 436-444. 1969; Wang in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 133-134. 1989). Further studies will need to characterize and distinguish them, not only from each other but also from the non-gemmiferous, Macaronesian A. anceps.This species is similar in outline to Asplenium trichomanes, but the plants can easily be distinguished by their triangular and winged stipe and rachis and by the presence of a bud on some fronds.

Sleep and Reichstein (Candollea 39: 675-691. 1984), following Morton (Contr. U.S. Natl. Herb. 38: 215-281. 1973), discussed the problem of the application of the name Asplenium laciniatum D. Don (Prodr. Fl. Nepal. 8. 1825). That name applies to a taxon closely related to A. varians, but its type is merely a depauperate single frond with a few spores and is not adequate for the precise application of the name. Moore (Index Fil. 139. 1857) and Hooker (Sp. Fil. 3: 164-165. 1860) misapplied the name A. laciniatum to another Himalayan fern species not related to A. varians, i.e., A. gueinzianum. Most later authors then followed that misapplied concept of A. laciniatum. Viane and Reichstein (Taxon 35: 605-606. 1986) formally proposed A. laciniatum for rejection, but their proposal was rejected by the Nomenclature Committee for Pteridophyta (Pichi Sermolli, Taxon 36: 740-741. 1987).Asplenium varians is variable, very similar to, and often confused with its ancestors, A. semivarians and A. tenuicaule (see above). Its relationships were discovered using hybridization experiments, chromosome counts, and micromorphology (Sleep & Reichstein, loc. cit.; Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003), showing it is an allotetraploid species that arose by chromosome doubling in the diploid hybrid between A. tenuicaule (A. tenuicaule var. subvarians in A. varians var. varians, and A. tenuicaule var. tenuicaule in the African A. varians var. fimbriatum) and A. semivarians. Two varieties are distinguished: A. varians var. varians, occurring in the Himalaya from N India into China (not in Japan), and var. fimbriatum, which is mainly found in S Africa (though its occurrence in S India needs further study). Asplenium paucijugum Ching is similar to A. semivarians but has larger spores and stomata. Further study is needed to show if this and related forms are autotetraploids of A. semivarians.In places where Asplenium tenuicaule and A. varians grow together, their sterile hybrid is not uncommon.In an outdated understanding of this complex, Fraser-Jenkins et al. (Indian Fern J. 27(1-2): 188. 2011) confusingly combined ancestral diploid and derived allotetraploid species and hybrids under a single amalgamate called Asplenium laciniatum, apparently ignoring hybridization experiments and cytological studies.

Most of the taxa put into synonymy of Asplenium wrightii were based on variable characters, often of relatively small plants (nicely fitting a herbarium sheet). Within this aggregate, the name A. wrightii is generally applicable to the larger plants, but existing herbarium material is inadequate as it does not cover the morphological variation and cytology is usually unknown. A set of morphological and size characters separates this complex into four major, but probably artificial, groups. A first, including A. wrightii, has pinnae more than 10 cm, sori more than 8 mm, and veins in the middle of the pinna 2-forked. A second group, including A. pseudowrightii, also has pinnae of more than 10 cm, but shorter sori (less than 8 mm), and veins only 1-forked in the middle of pinnae. Two groups with the largest pinnae less than 10 cm include A. wrightioides (with sori 6-11 mm) and A. centrochinense with sori less than 6 mm.Japanese plants (Kurita, Rep. (Annual) Foreign Students Coll. Chiba Univ. 41-56. 1967; Mitui, Bull. Nippon Dental Coll., Gen. Educ. 4: 221-271. 1975) are octoploids (2n = 288), but Z. R. Wang (in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 133-134. 1989) reported tetraploids (2n = 144) from Yunnan. Our recent flow-cytometry showed additional ploidy levels (10x and 12x), but because no correlation was found between ploidy levels and gross morphological characters, we refrain from recognizing separate species pending further micromorphological, cytological, and molecular research.Asplenium pseudowrightii was erroneously ascribed to Hainan. This was due to a wrong stamp on the holotype sheet in PE, which is without a collection label. However, all isotypes have the same collectors label (numbered "37818"), and collection labels state the plants origin: "Guangdong: Xin Yi, Har Sick Joun, stream side, 15 Nov. 1934." Some plants from near the type locality are tetraploid (the lowest ploidy level in this complex), while others are 12x (highest ploidy level in this aggregate).The type of Asplenium duplicatoserratum ("S. S. Sin 469A") is also a syntype of A. centrochinense f. maximum. Asplenium duplicatoserratum is a large plant with serrate to biserrate pinnae similar to those of A. wrightii but with much shorter sori.Asplenium ×wangii C. M. Kuo (Bot. Bull. Acad. Sin. 29: 109-111. 1988) is a hybrid between A. wrightii s.l. and A. bullatum; it was described from Taiwan and may be present where these taxa co-occur (Fujian, Guizhou, Hunan, Sichuan, Taiwan, and Yunnan). Asplenium ×shikokianum Makino (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 13: 13. 1899, pro sp., described from Japan), the natural hexaploid hybrid between octoploid A. wrightii and tetraploid A. ritoense, is not uncommon where its parents grow together (e.g., Guizhou, Taiwan). Asplenium ×kenzoi Kurata (J. Geobot. 11: 68. 1962) is from the cross with A. prolongatum.

Asplenium yoshinagae is a sexual octoploid plant in S India (Kuriachan in Fabbri, Caryologia 18: 675-731. 1965), Japan (Shimura & Takiguchi, J. Jap. Bot. 54: 311-318. 1979), and China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Xizang, and Yunnan). It is morphologically very variable and similar to A. indicum (see above). In China, A. yoshinagae is usually a larger and more vigorous plant with larger spores and stomata than A. indicum. They can easily be distinguished by a chromosome count or by flow-cytometry. The presence of gemmae is a highly unreliable character, at least in China, where most octoploids checked were not gemmiferous. Due to confusion among these taxa, the exact distribution of this species is not well documented.Asplenium tibeticum, only known from the type collection from Xizang, has leathery fronds morphologically almost intermediate between A. yoshinagae and A. gueinzianum; however, its long slender stipe scales and epidermal and soral cell patterns agree with those of A. yoshinagae, and its average exospore length of 40 µm also fits for this taxon.

Our description of Hymenasplenium adiantifrons differs from Chings, which was solely based on the type and the drawing of Hayata. Although Ching (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 10: 187-188. 1965) compared this taxon essentially to H. latidens, it is morphologically also similar to H. changputungense and H. szechuanense. In the literature (Kurata, J. Geobot. 11: 67-68. 1962; Sugimoto, Keys Herb. Pl. Jap. Pterid. 356, 406. 1966; Nakaike, Enum. Pterid. Jap. 97. 1975), this species has sometimes been synonymized or confused (Taiwan) with H. filipes (Copeland) Sugimoto (Philippines) from which it differs, i.a., by its retuse marginal teeth (entire in H. filipes), its shiny stipe and rachis (almost dull in H. filipes), and spreading pinnae (pointing upward in H. filipes).

As circumscribed, Hymenasplenium apogamum is an aggregate species, which, according to Cheng and Murakami (J. Plant Res. 111: 496. 1998), is both morphologically and cytologically variable. In China (Yunnan), it consists of sexual diploids (n = 39), sexual tetraploids (n = 78), and the more widespread agamosporous triploids ("n" = 2n = 117). In their 1998 publication (loc. cit.), Cheng and Murakami also recognized another triploid agamosporous taxon ("H. laterepens," nom. nud) related to H. apogamum but differing in its more triangular leaves. As the distribution and relationships of the Asian "unilaterale" group are not well understood, the present treatment only reflects the current state of limited knowledge.

Hymenasplenium cardiophyllum is often classified under Boniniella Hayata (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 41: 709. 1927), an endemic genus of E Asia here included in Hymenasplenium. Recent flow cytometric and cytological studies show that this taxon includes two cytologically different species: tetraploid Hymenasplenium ikenoi (Makino) Viane, comb. nov. (Basionym: Scolopendrium ikenoi Makino, Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 13: 130. 1899; Boniniella ikenoi (Makino) Hayata; Phyllitis ikenoi (Makino) C. Christensen), from Japan (Ryukyu Islands and Bonin Islands), and diploid H. cardiophyllum from China. Apart from their different chromosome number these taxa can also be separated by their average exospore length (21-24 µm for diploid H. cardiophyllum vs. 28-32 µm for tetraploid H. ikenoi. However, further studies need to unravel their exact relationships. Plants from Vietnam and Thailand (Boonkerd & Pollawatn, Sci. Asia 38: 125-128. 2012) require further study as to their ploidy level and true identity, as spore size of the Thai plants suggest a hexaploid situation.A study of its dorsiventral dictyostele, raphides, chromosome number, and perispore led Kato et al. (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 103: 461-468. 1990) to include H. ikenoi in Hymenasplenium. The chromosome number of 2n = 156 (Kato et al., loc. cit.: 463) indicates that H. ikenoi is a tetraploid with a basic chromosome number of x = 39; this recent count is in agreement with the n = 78 bivalents that can be counted on the photograph published by Kurita (Rep. (Annual) Foreign Students Coll. Chiba Univ. 7: 48. 1972). A base chromosome number of x = 38 or 39 coincides with that of Hymenasplenium.Kato et al. (loc. cit.: 467) suggested a closer affinity of Hymenasplenium ikenoi to H. excisum, H. apogamum, and H. obscurum than to H. cheilosorum and the group of H. cataractarum, H. hondoense, and H. obliquissimum. However, recent molecular studies seem to show that H. ikenoi is more closely related to the H. hondoense, H. apogamum, and H. cataractarum clade, and that it originated recently from the ancestor of the above three species (Murakami, J. Plant Res. 108: 257-268. 1995).

As presently circumscribed, Hymenasplenium cheilosorum is an aggregate of a widespread triploid agamosporous taxon and probably more local (Yunnan) sexual (diploid) and tetraploid (Guizhou) taxa. This distinctive complex was examined cytologically by Mehra and Bir (Cytologia 25: 17-27. 1960) using Himalayan material and later again by Mitui et al. (Amer. J. Bot. 76: 1689-1697. 1989) using Japanese plants. Mehra and Bir (loc. cit.) listed E Himalayan H. cheilosorum as a triploid agamosporous plant but with the incorrect chromosome number of "n" = 108 (based on x = 36). Mitui et al. (loc. cit.: 1690-1691) showed that both Himalayan and Japanese H. cheilosorum are apomictic and triploid, but with "n" = 2n = 117 (based on x = 39) chromosomes. Cheng and Murakami (J. Plant Res. 111: 495-500. 1998) found an ancestral sexual diploid taxon in Yunnan, with spore mother cells showing 39 bivalents at metaphase I, but without describing it formally as a separate species. We found a single tetraploid population in Guizhou (Yaoren Shan). Species of this alliance can be distinguished from the closely related, also sexually reproducing, H. inthanonense N. Murakami & J. Yokoyama from N Thailand, by their more terminal sori and more dimidiate pinnae.

Hymenasplenium excisum represents a distinct species complex with sexual diploids (2n = 78) and tetraploids (2n = 156) in China (Yunnan) and Indonesia (Mitui et al., Amer. J. Bot. 76: 1691. 1989; Cheng and Murakami, J. Plant Res. 111: 496. 1998). Cheng and Murakami (loc. cit.) mentioned a new endemic species complex, "H. costarisorum," from two localities in S Yunnan, said to be similar to H. excisum in gross morphology but different in smaller size, larger number of pinnae, more strongly reflexed lower pinnae, and sori restricted to the distal part of the pinnae. This undescribed taxon containing two cytotypes, a sexual diploid (n = 36) and a sexual tetraploid (n = 72), has a basic chromosome number of x = 36, which is universal in Aspleniaceae, except Hymenasplenium (with x = 38 and x = 39). Molecular data (Murakami, J. Plant Res. 108: 257-268. 1995) showed that this "species" is closely related to H. obscurum (with a chromosome number of x = 39)."Asplenium rahaoense" (Y. Yabe ex Matsumura & Hayata, J. Coll. Sci. Imp. Univ. Tokyo 22: 605. 1906) belongs here but is a nomen nudum and was not therefore validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)).

Fronds grayish green when dry, herbaceous; lamina 1-pinnate, narrowly triangular to lanceolate, 10-20 × 3-5 cm, widest in basal 1/3, gradually narrowing toward apex, glabrous; stipe shiny, purple, 10-25 × 0.05-0.15 cm, subglabrous, base sparsely scaly; rachis shiny, purplish abaxially, adaxial side grooved and with 2 grayish green narrow wings; pinnae almost sessile to shortly stalked with rachis color extending via stipicel onto base of costa abaxially, 15-25 pairs, alternate, usually ascending, trapeziform to falcate, 2-3.5 × 0.6-1 cm, base asymmetrical, acroscopic side truncate, basiscopic side attenuate-cuneate with 1/3-1/2 cut away, acroscopic margin serrate, teeth not retuse, pinna apex subacute to obtuse. Veins forking and terminating in marginal teeth, 2 or 3(or 4) basal basiscopic veins lacking. Sori linear, 4-5 mm, medial; indusia brownish, linear, membranous, entire, opening toward costa. Plants usually agamosporous.





Usually on wet rocks near streams in forests. Fujian, Guangxi, Sichuan [NE India, Japan, Korea, Nepal].

The distribution of Hymenasplenium hondoense is not well known due to confusion with other members of the genus. As presently circumscribed, this is a cytologically variable, aggregate species. Usually plants are agamosporous diploids ("n" = 2n = 72) or triploids ("n" = 2n = 117), but in China, sexual diploids and tetraploids exist. The elucidation of this aggregate and its relationships to the other SE Asian members of the "unilaterale" group will require more study.

Due to the previous confusion in the Hymenasplenium unilaterale s.l. group, the distribution of H. murakami-hatanakae is not well known. As an ancestral diploid, it may have played an important role in the reticulate evolution of Hymenasplenium in Asia and along the Pacific. However, the elucidation of relationships in the "unilaterale" group will require much more micromorphological and molecular studies. True H. unilaterale may be largely absent from India, the Himalaya, and the Pacific region, where its nomenclature urgently needs to be brought in line with data published by Cheng and Murakami (J. Plant Res. 111: 495-500. 1998).Asplenium pubirhizoma Ching & Z. Y. Liu, described from Sichuan, may represent a species of its own although it was considered a synonym of A. unilaterale s.l. by Wu (FRPS 4(2): 38. 1999); it is similar to Hymenasplenium murakami-hatanakae but differs in its gray, hairy scales and its more medial sori.

Hymenasplenium obliquissimum is an aggregate of species with different chromosome number and life strategy; three cytotypes, based on x = 39, are known. A diploid sexual (2n = 78), a tetraploid sexual (2n = 156), and a triploid agamosporous type (2n = 117) which is probably a hybrid between the diploid and the tetraploid (Murakami, Pl. Spec. Biol. 13: 51-56. 1998). A thin lamina (only 2 epidermal layers) is characteristic for this taxon but occurs elsewhere in the genus and is influenced by growing conditions; using it as a diagnostic character may lead to wrong identifications.In the literature (Iwatsuki, Ferns Japan, 151. 1992; Hasebe et al., Amer. Fern J. 85: 134-181. 1995; Iwatsuki et al., Fl. Japan 1: 109 1995), this species has sometimes been put into synonymy with Hymenasplenium filipes (Philippines), but considering cytological and morphological differences, we prefer to keep these taxa distinct. Hymenasplenium obliquissimum differs from H. filipes by its thinner lamina, thicker rhizome (up to 0.15 cm in H. filipes), shinier stipe and rachis (almost dull in H. filipes), rachis color extending onto the costa, larger number of pinnae (up to 15 in H. filipes), larger number of reduced basal basiscopic veins (1 or 2 in H. filipes), and sorus position along the subtending vein (median in H. filipes).Asplenium unilaterale Lamarck var. decurrens (Beddome) H. S. Kung (Fl. Sichuan. 6: 357. 1988; A. resectum Smith var. decurrens Beddome, Suppl. Ferns S. Ind. 10. 1876) was treated as a synonym of A. unilaterale var. udum in FRPS (4(2): 38-40. 1999).

Mitui et al. (Amer. J. Bot. 76: 1690-1691. 1989) reported that this species is a sexual tetraploid with 2n = 156 in Java (Indonesia). Cheng and Murakami (J. Plant Res. 111: 496. 1998) and Kato et al. (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 105: 105-124. 1992) reported related sexual diploid and tetraploid taxa from Yunnan (see under Hymenasplenium pseudobscurum), and we found hexaploids in Hainan; consequently, the taxon as here circumscribed is a complex with different cytotypes involved. Contrary to literature citations, Asplenium serriforme Mettenius is not listed here as a synonym because the drawing and the description by Mettenius (Abh. Senckenberg. Naturf. Ges. 3: 163. 1859) clearly state that it has retuse ("serraturae obtusae emarginato") teeth, and thus it represents another taxon probably more related to the H. adiantifrons group.In Taiwan most specimens formerly identified as Hymenasplenium obscurum have an inner and outer indusium and are H. pseudobscurum (Ralf Knapp, pers. comm.); the detailed occurrence of true H. obscurum in China needs more study, and its presence in Taiwan requires confirmation.

Murakami (J. Plant Res. 108: 261. 1995) used, but did not validly publish, the name "bilabiatum" for this taxon; he reported it from N Thailand to N Vietnam and from Taiwan. Hymenasplenium pseudobscurum is an aggregate of a diploid and a tetraploid taxon (Kato et al., Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 105: 105-124. 1992; Cheng & Murakami, J. Plant Res. 111: 498. 1998), and further research is needed to discriminate between them. Molecular studies of Murakami (loc. cit.: 266) demonstrated that H. pseudobscurum is closely related to H. obscurum.The special allantodioid sorus, with an inner and an outer indusium, is also found in Hymenasplenium bivalvatum (B. K. Nayar & Geevarghese) Viane, comb. et stat. nov. (Basionym: Asplenium unilaterale Lamarck var. bivalvatum B. K. Nayar & Geevarghese, Fern Fl. Malabar, 292. 1993; 双盖膜叶铁角蕨 shuang gai mo ye tie jiao jue), a sexual diploid with 2n = 78 chromosomes and differing from H. pseudobscurum by the abaxial color of its stipe (shiny and dark purple to black). The occurrence of H. bivalvatum in S China needs to be verified; however, according to Ralf Knapp (pers. comm.), most Taiwanese specimens formerly identified as H. obscurum are H. pseudobscurum.

Hymenasplenium quercicola is most similar to H. szechuanense from which it differs in its more castaneous-purple stipe, more spreading pinnae, and more medial sori. Several sporangia of the type have an orange color and appear collapsed or not fully developed, typical features of hybrids in this family. Due to confusion with similar species, the relationships and the distribution of this taxon are not well known.

The description of Hymenasplenium subnormale is based on the Yunnan material, which might represent an undescribed species. The type of H. subnormale, collected in the Philippines, is a smaller plant in general and differs also essentially from other members of Hymenasplenium in its venation pattern with none of the basiscopic veins lacking (isotypes in MICH!, B!). Morphological variation within this taxon has been pointed out by Holttum (Revis. Fl. Malaya 2: 437-438. 1954) and Iwatsuki (Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 27: 51. 1975; Fl. Jap. 1: 108. 1995). Mitui et al. (Amer. J. Bot. 76: 1691. 1989) reported a base chromosome number of x = 38 instead of the "normal" x = 39 for most of the other species in the genus. They also found both diploids (n = 38, 2n = 78) and tetraploids (n = 78) in a collection from Ceram (Indonesia). Cheng and Murakami (J. Plant Res. 111: 495-500. 1998) reported a related diploid taxon ("Asplenium latipinnum," nom. nud.) with n = 39 from Yunnan, differing by its more inframedial sori, but without formally publishing it as a new taxon. This taxon is thus clearly an aggregate, and plants from outside of the Philippines may represent one or more related species. The whole complex needs a thorough revision.

Hymenasplenium szechuanense is similar to H. furfuraceum from which it differs in its much less floccose to subglabrous rachis and stipe, its inframedial sori, and its more reddish purple rachis. It differs from H. quercicola in its inframedial sori and more dark purple stipe. Hymenasplenium latidens is also similar but differs by the characters given in the key and by its slightly more numerous pinna pairs; future research will have to show their relationship. All these taxa also resemble H. obliquissimum but that species has its veins ending in marginal teeth, not below a notch in a marginal tooth as in this group. Due to confusion with similar taxa, the relationships and the distribution of this species are not well known.

Hymenasplenium wuliangshanense is most similar to the following taxa: H. furfuraceum to H. changputungense. The upper margin of its pinnae is finely and regularly denticulate, with relatively deep notches (often as deep as the teeth) so that there is no obvious difference between a notch and a "normal" sinus. Hymenasplenium latidens has slightly coarser teeth and more medial sori. It is also similar to H. adiantifrons, which has a more coarsely cut margin and a more castaneous-purple rachis. Future research will have to establish the true relationships in this group. This and the following seven species form a group of related taxa that can best be distinguished by their veins that terminate below a notch in each marginal tooth. A similar taxon, Asplenium ofeliae Soldago, is known from the Philippines.

Athyrium brevifrons is very close to A. rubripes, but their relationship is still in need of investigation.The name "Athyrium brevifrons Naki" used for this taxon in FRPS (3(2): 162. 1999) was ascribed to Kitagawa (Rep. First Sci. Exped. Manchoukuo Sect. 4(2): 75. 1935), but that is a nomen nudum, as are most other citations given in FRPS. However, by including the valid taxon A. filix-femina (Linnaeus) Roth var. longipes as a synonym, Tagawa effectively validated the binomial Athyrium brevifrons Nakai ex Tagawa. The name A. multidentatum (Döll) Ching, based on Aspidium filix-femina Swartz var. multidentatum Döll, has been included within this taxon and would have priority, but Ching indicated that the inclusion was based on a misapplication of the name by Fomin (Fl. Sibir. Orient. Extremi 5: 108. 1930). Dölls protologue has not been seen, but if, as seems likely, it was based on European material Chings interpretation would seem correct. "Athyrium extensum" (Ching in Y. L. Zhang et al., Sporae Pterid. Sin. 209. 1976) belongs here but was not validly published because no Latin description or diagnosis, or reference to such, was provided (Melbourne Code, Art. 39.1).

Liu et al. (Fern Fl. Taiwan, 50. 2009) argue that Athyrium foliolosum does not occur in Taiwan, where it is replaced by the similar A. tripinnatum.The specific epithet was based on "Asplenium foliolosum" (Wallich, Numer. List, no. 2205. 1830), which is a nomen nudum and was not therefore validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)). Wallichs no. 2205 included several specimens with different collection details. Some, with purplish rachises and small indusia, match Athyrium fimbriatum, whereas others, with stramineous rachises and large indusia, belong to A. foliolosum. "Aspidium squarrosum" (Wallich, Numer. List, no. 356. 1829), not D. Don (1825), is another nomen nudum that belongs here.

J. Z. Wang and S. H. Li (in P. Y. Fu et al., Clav. Pl. Chin. Bor.-Orient. 35. 1995) considered that Athyrium rupestre Kodama occurs in Jilin. It is characterized by the perispore surface without folds and the pinnae pinnatipartite to pinnatisect, less than 1 cm wide, and long acuminate. Athyrium rupestre is distributed in Hokkaido and N Honshu, Japan, and E Russia. If the identification by J. Z. Wang and S. H. Li (1995) is correct, the species should be new to China.

Knapp (Ferns Fern Allies Taiwan, 439. 2011) noted that Athyrium otophorum is closely allied with A. delavayi, A. epirachis, and A. pubicostatum; and, although it is often distinguished by the glabrous abaxial surface of the rachis and costae, sessile pinnae, and auriculate pinnule bases, its diagnostic characters are not always definite.

Athyrium sinense is very similar to A. dentigerum in frond morphology; it differs from A. dentigerum by the 2 or 3(or 4) pairs of shortened basal pinnae.Athyrium filix-femina (Linnaeus) Roth s.l. of China occurs widely from NE to SW China. In fact, it included A. brevifrons, A. sinense, and A. dentigerum. Mature plants of the three species differ morphologically and geographically. Athyrium brevifrons occurs in NE and N China; only the basal 1 or 2 pairs of pinnae are slightly shortened, and the stipes are relatively markedly long. Athyrium dentigerum occurs in SW China; its numerous lower pinnae are gradually shortened toward the base, and the stipes are very short. Qin Ling plants of A. sinense are morphologically and geographically intermediate between A. brevifrons and A. dentigerum: in A. sinense several pairs of pinnae are slightly shortened toward the base. The three are probably subspecies of one species, pending further analysis. All three species are different from European A. filix-femina.
