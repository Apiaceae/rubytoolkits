Plants small to medium-sized, predominantly epilithic or terrestrial, but also many epiphytic. Rhizome creeping, decumbent, or erect, radial or dorsiventral (Hymenasplenium), sometimes massive and bearing detritus-collecting fronds, scaly; scales narrowly triangular, clathrate with anticlinal walls thickened and periclinal walls translucent, often costate and with a central zone of cells with thicker anticlinal walls, in some taxa becoming completely opaque, rarely whole scale black and opaque, margins entire, dentate, or with short or long outgrowths (fimbriate scales), often with a terminal glandular cell, both surfaces glabrous. Fronds remote (in China mainly in Hymenasplenium) or clustered, spirally arranged or in two abaxial rows (Hymenasplenium), herbaceous or leathery to subfleshy, with scales similar to those on rhizome or gradually reduced in size (mini-scales) and filiform to hastate-stellate, usually with small, 3- or 4-celled uniseriate hairs terminating in a gland, rarely glandular or completely glabrous, occasionally gemmiferous with buds often on, but not restricted to, rachis or at pinna apex; stipe usually distinct, not articulate, rarely forming a trophopod (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum) or persistent (Hymenasplenium), distinctly scaly at base, green to grayish brown, in some species castaneous to black and then often shiny, rounded to grooved (sulcate) adaxially, with two vascular bundles at its base, upward near rachis combined into one X-shaped bundle. Lamina outline variable, from simple to 4-pinnate, apical pinnae usually reduced and confluent into a pinnatifid apex, rarely conform with lateral pinnae (e.g., A. formosae), usually branching anadromously; rachis structure variable, adaxially often sulcate, with or without central supravascular ridge, with or without lateral wings derived from decurrent frond margins, rarely with an abaxial wing (A. tripteropus); pinnae and other divisions often more strongly developed in direction of apex, ultimate pinnules or segments often rhombic, trapeziform, or cuneiform with asymmetrical base, rarely dimidiate, margin rarely entire, more often repand or sinuate to crenate or serrate, each tooth usually with a single vein. Veins mostly free, anadromously branching, veinlets usually not reaching margin, with or without terminal hydathode, rarely anastomosing near margin or with a marginal connecting vein (A. subg. Thamnopteris C. Presl); some species with a dissected lamina have one single vein per ultimate segment. Sori single, rarely "double" on two different veins (A. subg. Phyllitis (Hill) Jermy & Viane), or J-shaped (e.g., A. fontanum), linear to subelliptic, attached along one side of a veinlet, usually indusiate (indusium reduced in A. subg. Ceterach (Willdenow) Vida ex Bir, Fraser-Jenkins & Lovis); indusia thinly membranous to thick and firm, usually flat but occasionally rolling back at maturity, free margin entire to erose, sinuate, fimbriate, glandular, or rarely with mini-scales, attached laterally along a veinlet, opening toward costa, costule, or vein from which soriferous vein originated, in some species with a dissected lamina seemingly opening toward margin (A. prolongatum). Sporangia with a vertical annulus of ca. 20 thickened cells, stalk uniseriate, not glandular. Spores usually 64 per sporangium, bilateral, elliptic to reniform, monolete; exospore smooth, perispores elaborate and very variable, consisting of three layers, outer with ridges (lophate), spines (echinate), or with large pori (reticulate) and no ridges or spines, or a combination. Plants sexual or agamosporous and then often with only 32 spores per sporangium, x = (35)36 in Asplenium, but (36, 38)39 in Hymenasplenium.

Two genera and ca. 700 species: subcosmopolitan, but mainly in montane and (sub)tropical regions; two genera and 108 species and species complexes (Hymenasplenium) (25 endemic) in China.

Five genera and ca. 600 species: worldwide from tropical to frigid zones of both hemispheres; five genera and 278 species (135 endemic) in China.





Of the genera recognized in FRPS (3(2): 32-504. 1999), Rhachidosorus and Diplaziopsis were recently segregated as families Rhachidosoraceae and Diplaziopsidaceae, respectively. Athyriaceae s.s. or subfamily Athyrioideae comprise Anisocampium (including Kuniwatsukia), Athyrium (including Pseudocystopteris), Cornopteris (including Neoathyrium), Deparia (including Athyriopsis, Dictyodroma, Dryoathyrium, and Lunathyrium), and Diplazium (including Allantodia, Callipteris, and Monomelangium). Subfamily Cystopteridoideae was raised to family Cystopteridaceae.Wang Zhong-ren, Chu Wei-ming, He Zhao-rong & Hsieh Yin-tang. 1999. Athyriaceae (excluding Acystopteris, Cystoathyrium, Cystopteris, Diplaziopsis, Gymnocarpium, and Rhachidosorus). In: Chu Wei-ming, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 3(2): 32-511.

About (2-)14 genera and ca. 250 species: worldwide, but with greatest diversity in the S tropics; eight genera and 14 species (one endemic) in China.





Stenochlaena has been separated as the sole genus of Stenochlaenaceae or Blechnaceae subfamily Stenochlaenoideae. Christenhusz et al. (Phytotaxa 19: 48-49. 2011) listed seven genera of Blechnaceae but indicated that the actual number of genera was very uncertain and could be anywhere between two and nine, depending mainly on a better understanding of Blechnum.Shing Kunghsia. 1990. Stenochlaenaceae. In: Ching Renchang & Shing Kunghsia, eds., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 3(1): 94-97; Wu Shiew-hung. 1999. Blechnaceae. In: Wu Shiew-hung, ed., Fl. Reipubl.

One of us (Nooteboom) considers that only one genus, Davallia, can be recognized in the Davalliaceae. Paradavallodes multidentata is nested in Araiostegia + Davallodes, which is a polymorphic basal clade. Among species examined, A. hymenophylloides (Blume) Copeland is the type of Araiostegia, and P. multidentata is the type of Paradavallodes. Therefore, the earliest published-Davallodes (Copeland) Copeland-should be used as the generic name. However, from morphology and DNA there are no arguments to recognize this genus. The Humata clade looks quite distinct as an entity, although it contains Davallia corniculata, renamed to H. corniculata by Kato, and in all other systems this is a Davallia. Tsutsumi, Zhang and Kato did not analyze D. wagneriana Copeland and included it in Davallia, but morphologically this is the closest relative of D. corniculata. It should belong to Humata; or better, Humata is part of Davallia (Tsutsumi, Zhang & Kato, Syst. Bot. 33: 44-48. 2008).However, two of us (Xing and Wang) consider that morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies do not support there being only one genus (e.g., Sen, Sen & Holttum, Kew Bull. 27: 217-243. 1972; Kato and Tsutsumi, Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 59: 1-14. 2008; and Tsutsumi, Zhang & Kato, Syst. Bot. 33: 44-48. 2008). A recent study about the leaf epidermis and spore morphology of Davalliaceae (He Chunmei, A taxonomic revision of Davalliaceae in China. Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou. 2012) also supports Araiostegia, Humata, and Paradavallodes as natural genera.Polyploidy, through hybridization and polyploidization, has been assessed in the Humata group, and these polyploids appeared to be apomictic. This could very well also be the case in other groups. With only cpDNA, the phylogeny of a group like this cannot be assessed. Moreover, in Davalliaceae, incongruence between CpDNA and nrDNA is found on the generic level but is not yet explained (C. W. Chen et al., Insights into Evolutionary History of the Humata repens Complex in Taiwan. 5th Symp. Asian Pteridol. Fern Show: Progr. & Abstr. 42. 2010; C. W. Chen & Nooteboom, ined.).Ching Ren-chang, Fu Shu-hsia, Wang Chu-hao & Shing Gung-hsia. 1959. Davalliaceae (excluding Arthropteris, Gymnogrammitis, Leucostegia, and Nephrolepis).

Traditionally, only two genera-Hymenophyllum with bivalved involucres and Trichomanes Linnaeus with tubular involucres-have been recognized in this family. This scheme was expanded by Morton (Contr. U.S. Natl. Herb. 29: 139-202. 1968) who hierarchically placed many subgenera, sections, and subsections under two larger genera, Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes, and recognized four monotypic genera, Cardiomanes Morton, Serpyllopsis Morton, Hymenoglossum Morton, and Rosenstockia Morton, all of which have specialized fronds. Conversely, Copeland (Gen. Fil. 31-44. 1947) split the family into 34 genera, basing his work on herbarium specimens as well as his field observations of Asian material. Taking into account these past studies plus recent investigations including molecular data, Ebihara et al. (Blumea 51: 221-280. 2006) proposed a modern scheme of classification on which the system of this treatise is based.Ching Ren-chang, Fu Shu-hsia, Wang Chu-hao & Shing Gung-hsia. 1959. Hymenophyllaceae. In: Ching Ren-chang, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 2: 132-196, 350-357, 379.

Plants rupestral or rarely terrestrial, medium-sized. Rhizomes shortly creeping, ascending, or long creeping, stout, densely covered with scales and hairs or only scales; scales ovate-lanceolate or rarely linear-lanceolate. Fronds approximate, subclustered, or remote; stipe stramineous, base swollen into shuttle form and concealed in scales (Hypodematium), or articulate to rhizome, glabrous (Leucostegia); lamina deltoid or ovate-oblong to pentagonal-ovate, 3-pinnate to finely 4-pinnate-pinnatifid, anadromous, herbaceous or papery, both surfaces, rachises, and costules frequently covered with acicular and/or glandular hairs, rarely glabrous.

Leucostegia has long been assigned to Davalliaceae because of its creeping, dorsiventral rhizome densely covered by scales, its dissected leaves, and its indusia. Molecular phylogenetic analysis has shown that Leucostegia is closely related to Hypodematium.Ching Ren-chang, Fu Shu-hsia, Wang Chu-hao & Shing Gung-hsia. 1959. Leucostegia.

Some pteridologists recognize a narrowly defined Lycopodiaceae s.s. and Huperziaceae with the latter comprising Huperzia, Phlegmariurus, and Phylloglossum Kunze, considering that the split between Huperziaceae and Lycopodiaceae s.s. has been dated to ca. 350 million years ago using plastid rbcL data (Wikström & Kenrick, Molec. Phylogen. Evol. 19: 177-186. 2001), an age much older than many extant fern families/orders. In spite of this, here Lycopodiaceae s.l. including Huperziaceae is recognized because of the sister relationship between Huperziaceae and Lycopodiaceae s.s.In the Lycopodiaceae, sometimes Lycopodiastrum is subsumed under Lycopodium. However, the split between Lycopodiastrum and Lycopodium s.s. has been dated to the Permian Period (251-299 million years ago), much earlier than when extant species of Lycopodium s.s. started to diversify (Wikström & Kenrick, loc. cit.). Also, the morphology of Lycopodiastrum is distinct from Lycopodium. Therefore, Lycopodiastrum is recognized here.Zhang Libing. 2004. Huperziaceae and Lycopodiaceae. In: Zhang Xianchun, ed., Fl.

Plants mostly epiphytic and epilithic, a few terrestrial. Rhizomes shortly to long creeping, dictyostelic, bearing scales. Fronds monomorphic or dimorphic, mostly simple to pinnatifid or 1-pinnate (uncommonly more divided); stipes cleanly abscising near their bases or not (most grammitids), leaving short phyllopodia; veins often anastomosing or reticulate, sometimes with included veinlets, or veins free (most grammitids); indument various, of scales, hairs, or glands. Sori abaxial (rarely marginal), orbicular to oblong or elliptic, occasionally elongate, or sporangia acrostichoid, sometimes deeply embedded, sori exindusiate, sometimes covered by caducous scales (soral paraphyses) when young; sporangia with 1-3-rowed, usually long stalks, frequently with paraphyses on sporangia or on receptacle; spores hyaline to yellowish, reniform, and monolete (non-grammitids), or greenish and globose-tetrahedral, trilete (most grammitids); perine various, usually thin, not strongly winged or cristate. Mostly x = 35, 36, 37.

Rhizome erect, prostrate, creeping, ascending, or scandent, branched. Rootlike rhizophores borne on dorsal (upper) or ventral (lower) side in axils of branches, confined to lower part of rhizome or throughout, simple or branched. Roots formed at tip of rhizophore, branched. Leaves simple, 1-veined (exceptionally forked), each bearing a ligule in axil on adaxial surface, monomorphic or dimorphic, spirally arranged or in most species arranged in 4 ranks, 2 ranks on dorsal or upper side of stem and branch (called median or dorsal leaves), other 2 ranks on lateral or lower side (called lateral or ventral leaves). Strobili at apex of main stem or branch or lateral to branchlet, compact or lax, tetragonal, complanate or rarely cylindrical; sporophylls arranged in 4 ranks, monomorphic or dimorphic; in dorsiventral strobili with dimorphic sporophylls, dorsal (upper) sporophylls of most species larger than ventral (lower) ones (=resupinate), dorsal sporophylls normally green and firm in texture, while ventral ones paler and somewhat membranous, or dorsal sporophylls smaller than ventral sporophylls (=non-resupinate); in some dorsiventral strobili, dorsal sporophylls bearing outgrowths on lower surface, like a flap, termed "sporophyll-pteryx," partially covering sporangium proximal to it. Sporophylls various, ranging from ovate to ovate-lanceolate, margin denticulate, ciliolate, or entire, apex acute and entire, with ligules distal to sporangia.

The number of genera and species in this family has been in considerable flux. Molecular studies (Hasebe et al., Amer. Fern J. 85: 134-181. 1995) have increased our understanding of many fern families, and the placement of many uncertainly placed genera has recently become more evident. The genera Ctenitis (incl. Ataxipteris), Dryopsis (= Dryopteris sect. Dryopsis), and Lastreopsis, which were previously placed in Tectariaceae, are now known to belong to the Dryopteridaceae (Hasebe et al., loc. cit.; Smith et al., Taxon 55: 717. 2006; Liu et al., Sci. China, C, 50: 789-798. 2007) and are treated in that family in this Flora. The two families have always been difficult to separate on a morphological basis, but molecular evidence shows that Tectariaceae in its strict sense is sister to a clade uniting Polypodiaceae, Oleandraceae, and Davalliaceae. The group directly sister to Tectariaceae is Lomariopsidaceae (incl. Nephrolepidaceae), which in turn forms a sister clade to Dryopteridaceae, together forming the Eupolypods I clade (Smith et al., loc. cit.: 707).Few molecular studies have so far addressed the Tectariaceae as a whole, and the generic delimitations are, therefore, far from established. Recent studies suggest that a number of segregate genera is deeply embedded within Tectaria, making it a somewhat polymorphic genus. Here, we have followed this broad concept of Tectaria, and included the genera Ctenitopsis, Hemigramma, and Quercifilix. This is admittedly a conservative approach, but it will have to suffice for the purposes of the present treatment until further studies provide a better understanding and better established delimitation of the genera within Tectariaceae.Pleocnemia and Pteridrys are maintained as separate from Tectaria s.l. because they show sufficient molecular and morphological distinctness. Pleocnemia was tentatively placed in Dryopteridaceae by Liu et al. (loc. cit.), but evidence for this is scarce, and we, therefore, maintain it here in Tectariaceae following Smith et al. (loc. cit.: 718), until further data are available.The following taxon, described from China, is excluded from the present treatment, pending further research: Sagenia cicutaria (Linnaeus) T. Moore var. tenerifrons Christ (Bull. Acad. Int. Géogr. Bot. 11: 257. 1902).Ching Ren-chang, Fu Shu-hsia, Wang Chu-hao & Shing Gung-hsia. 1959. Arthropteris. In: Ching Ren-chang, ed., Fl. Reipubl.

Plants terrestrial or on rocks. Rhizomes stout, dictyostele radially symmetrical, branched or not, erect, ascending, or long creeping, with scales at apices; scales basiflexed, lanceolate or nearly ovate, brown, thick, luminae elongate, usually with grayish white short setae on dorsal side or ciliate along margins. Fronds clustered, approximate, or remote; stipes slender, stramineous, not articulate, with 2 crescent-shaped vascular bundles at base, usually scaly at bases, distally ± with grayish white unicellular acicular hairs, rarely with multicellular long hairs or stellate hairs. Fronds monomorphic, rarely subdimorphic, oblong-lanceolate or oblanceolate, sometimes ovate or ovate-triangular, usually pinnate-pinnatifid, sometimes 3- or 4-pinnate-pinnatifid, rarely 1-pinnate; pinnae symmetrical at bases; costae grooved adaxially but grooves not confluent with rachial grooves, or raised and with dense grayish acicular hairs, with expanded tuberculate aerophores at bases of pinnae. Laminae herbaceous or papery, sometimes somewhat leathery, green or dark brown-green when dry, both sides (particularly rachises, costae, and main veins adaxially) with grayish white unicellular acicular hairs, rarely glabrous, usually with orange or reddish orange, stalked or sessile spherical or club-shaped glands, occasionally small scaly along rachises and costae abaxially. Sori orbicular, oblong, or shortly linear, dorsifixed on veins, indusiate or exindusiate; indusia orbicular-reniform, fixed by deep notch, most ± hairy, persistent or hidden in sori, caducous, or not concentrated into sori but scattered along reticulate veins and exindusiate. Sporangia long stalked, usually with hairs or glandular hairs below annuli and at distal end of sporangial stalks. Spores bilateral, rarely tetrahedral, tuberculate, echinate, granular, or usually with a winged perispore. Prothalli green, cordate or narrowly cordate, usually with broad wings, symmetrical, usually with hairs or glands. x = 27-36 (lacking 28).

About 20 genera and ca. 1,000 species, more at lower elevations, very few tropical species above 4500 m: widespread in all tropical and subtropical zones of the world, less common in temperate zone, particularly more common in Asia; 18 genera (one endemic) and 199 species (102 endemic) in China.





The family* is very natural and is distinguished from others by having grayish white unicellular acicular hairs and pubescence throughout the plant. However, there are many different viewpoints about generic circumscription in the family. Ching recognized 18 genera (including Hypodematium) in his 1963 treatment (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 8: 289-335); soon afterward, in 1978 (Ching, Acta Phytotax. Sin. 16(3): 12-13), the number of recognized genera in China grew to 20 (Hypodematium was removed and placed in its own family). In 1971, Holttum subdivided this family in the Paleotropics into 23 genera (Blumea 19(1): 17-52). In 1977, Pichi Sermolli, mainly following Holttum, circumscribed other genera for a total of 32 genera (Webbia 3(2): 213-512). In 1990, A. R. Smith divided the family into five genera (in Kramer & Green, Fam. Gen. Vasc. Pl. 1: 263-272), i.e., Thelypteris (including five subgenera), Phegopteris, Pseudophegopteris, Macrothelypteris, and Cyclosorus (including 20 subgenera). Of the many systems, those of Holttum and Pichi Sermolli divide the family most finely, with the greatest number of genera. Holttum (loc. cit.) segregated the following genera from Cyclosorus s.l.: Amphineuron, Christella, Pneumatopteris, and Sphaerostephanos. Recognition of these genera was based on several characters, including whether the proximal pinnae were shortened or not, and whether the sporangia and sporangial stalks bore hairs or glandular hairs. Holttum (loc. cit.) also segregated several genera (e.g., Parathelypteris and Coryphopteris) from the classical Thelypteris s.l., the free-veined thelypteroids, by characters that included rhizome habit, laminar glands, and chromosome base number. Smith (loc. cit.: 265) noted: "Although many of Holttums genera seem natural (i.e., monophyletic), a combination of characters must be used to circumscribe them. Some of the characters concern minute glands and hairs and require 30 × magnification or greater for observation. Others require that complete specimens be at hand (including lower part of blade and stem). Even then, identification to genus may be difficult, as generic lines are not always sharp." The question of generic delimitation within the family needs further study, but for now we adopt Chings system (1978), modified from Ching (1963).***In 1940, Ching established many new families (Sunyatsenia 5(4): 237), including Thelypteridaceae with 12 genera, but the names of these new families are nomina nuda and were not therefore validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)). Only in 1970 were these families formally published by Pichi Sermolli.**(1) Holttum set up the genus Amphineuron with mixed characters in 1971, which was also adopted by Ching in 1978. Among the 12 recognized species in the genus, three occur in China: the type species A. opulentum, which is similar to Cyclosorus in venation and lemon-yellow glands; A. immersum, which is similar to Parathelypteris species in venation; and A. tonkinensis, which has already been removed to a new genus, Mesopteris. As Holttum himself considered Amphineuron to be a provisional treatment, this genus is not adopted here.(2) Trichoneuron Ching (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 10: 118, pl. 22. 1967) was based on a single gathering, and the collection locality was unknown. Later, this species was rediscovered by Prof. W. M. Chu in Pingbian, SE Yunnan. According to Prof. Chus study, it belongs to the genus Lastreopsis (Dryopteridaceae). It is, therefore, not included here.Using only venation, the family may be divided into 3 tribes: 1. Tribe Thelypterideae Ching: Veins free; with two subtypes: (1) all veinlets reaching margins or nearly reaching margins above sinuses between segments, with the bottom of sinuses not cartilaginous (e.g., Parathelypteris); (2) proximal pair of veinlets from adjacent segments reaching cartilaginous sinuses but not united; or acroscopic veinlet of basal pair of veinlets reaching cartilaginous sinus, basiscopic veinlet reaching margin above sinus (e.g., Pseudocyclosorus and Mesopteris); 2. Tribe Goniopterideae Ching: Veins partly combined; at least proximal pair of veinlets from adjacent segments united to form triangular areoles and this vein union producing a long or short excurrent veinlet; additional areoles may be produced in the same row, by subsequent vein unions of veinlets; excurrent veinlets may connect with more distal vein unions, or with a translucent line leading to a sinus, thus forming oblique rhomboid areoles (goniopteroid venation) (e.g., Cyclosorus, Ampelopteris), or squarish areoles (meniscioid venation) (e.g., Pronephrium, the areoles without included veinlets; 3. Tribe Dictyoclineae Ching: Veinlets between lateral veins all combined into irregular squarish or pentagonal areoles and each areole sometimes with simple or forked included veinlets.The following taxon is excluded from the present treatment, pending further research: Thelypteris calvata Ching (Bull. Fan Mem. Inst. Biol. Bot. ser. 2, 1: 313. 1949), described from Guangdong.Shing Kunghsia, Chiu Peishi, Yao Guanhu & Lin Youxin. 1999. Thelypteridaceae. In: Shing Kunghsia, ed., Fl. Reipubl. Popularis Sin. 4(1): 15-317, 319-353.
