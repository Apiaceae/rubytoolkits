Spores brown to dark brown, perispore lophate (cristate-alate), with average exospore length 32-37 µm. Plants sexual allotetraploids: 2n = 144.
200004099 | On rocks or on forest floor near streams; 2000-3000 m. Shaanxi, Taiwan, E Xizang, NW Yunnan [Afghanistan, N India, Pakistan; Europe (Mediterranean to SW Asia), W North America].
200004099 | Asplenium adiantum-nigrum, an allotetraploid species that originated via chromosome doubling in a hybrid (A. ×ligusticum Bernardello et al.) between A. cuneifolium Viviani and A. onopteris Linnaeus, is unrelated to the distantly similar A. interjectum. Asplenium adiantum-nigrum differs by the thickened stipe base (trophopod) and the less deltoid lamina.

250038104 | On rocks in mixed forests; 1000-2600 m. Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan [India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam; tropical Africa, tropical America, Australia, Macaronesia, Pacific islands (Hawaii)].
250038104 | Asplenium aethiopicum is a morphologically, ecologically, and karyologically very variable aggregate for which we prefer to use the oldest available epithet. Braithwaite (Cytotax. Invest. Asplenium aethiopicum Complex Africa, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Leeds. 1964; Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 93: 348-378. 1986), Panigrahi (Phytologia 31: 251-258. 1975), Manton et al. (Bull. Brit. Mus. (Nat. Hist.), Bot. 15: 123-161. 1986), and Ormonde (Bol. Mus. Munic. Funchal 43: 177-189. 1991; Acta Bot. Malac. 16: 293-315. 1991) have shown that A. aethiopicum s.l. is an aggregate of at least three sexual (A. aethiopicum subsp. tripinnatum (Baker) A. F. Braithwaite (4x), A. aethiopicum subsp. aethiopicum (8x), and A. aethiopicum subsp. dodecaploideum A. F. Braithwaite (12x)) and up to five apomictic taxa. Most of these cytotypes are common in Africa, but sexual tetraploids and dodecaploids are also known from Asia and America, where Swartzs name, A. praemorsum, is used for the aggregate. Besides differing in chromosome number and pairing behavior, the members of this aggregate can also be separated on the basis of their exospore size. The agamosporous taxa can be distinguished from the sexual by the length/width ratio of their spores: agamosporous taxa have subglobose spores with a ratio smaller than 1.4, sexual taxa have reniform to plano-convex spores with a ratio larger than 1.4. Based on Braithwaites (Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 93: 343-378. 1986) key, Chinese specimens are probably sexual A. aethiopicum subsp. dodecaploideum but need cytological confirmation. We found hybrids with A. austrochinense in Jiangxi.

242305799 | Asplenium spathulinum J. Smith ex Hooker (1860), not Kunze (1848).
242305799 | Plants 30-65 cm tall. Rhizome erect or ascending, scaly; scales brown, narrowly triangular, margins subdentate. Fronds caespitose; stipe dull grayish brown to gray-green, semiterete, 13-30 cm, subglabrous, adaxially sulcate; lamina triangular to ovate, 21-36 × 10-20 cm, not much reduced at base, apex acute-acuminate, bipinnate; pinnae 12-18 pairs, subopposite to alternate, stalks 2-3 mm, basal pinnae largest or slightly reduced, narrowly triangular, 7-14 × 3.5-4.5 cm, apex variable, from acute to caudate, 1-pinnate; pinnules 4-8 pairs, anadromous, free to subsessile, from ovate-elliptic to rhombic or cuneiform, apex obtuse, basal acroscopic pinnule ± equal to basal basiscopic pinnule, basal pair largest, 1.5-3 × 1-1.3 cm, base nearly symmetrical, cuneate, distal segments decurrent on rachis, lateral sides entire, outer margin dentate to crenate. Costa obvious on both sides, raised abaxially, adaxially shallowly grooved with raised supravascular ridge, veins 2- or 3-forked and not reaching margin. Fronds herbaceous, brownish green when dry, subglabrous; rachis grayish brown to gray-green, adaxially sulcate, apical part of rachis often gemmiferous. Sori 1-4 per pinnule, not reaching margin, linear, 5-10 mm; indusia brownish, linear, membranous, entire, opening toward costa or costule, persistent.
242305799 | Epiphytic in forests; 600-1400 m. Hainan [Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka; Mascarene Islands].
242305799 | Hookers name, Asplenium spathulinum, has often been used to describe this variable taxon (e.g., Beddome, Ferns S. India, t. 226. 1864; Tardieu & Ching, Notul. Syst. (Paris) 5: 134-154. 1936; Holttum, Revis. Fl. Malaya 2: 439. 1954; Copeland, Fern Fl. Philipp. 3: 445. 1960; Chun et al., Fl. Hainan. 1: 116. 1964; S. H. Wu, FRPS 4(2): 70. 1999; T. L. Wu et al., Fl. Guangdong 7: 198. 2006). Manton and Sledge (Philos. Trans., Ser. B, 238: 127-185. 1954) showed that A. affine is an aggregate of an octoploid and a dodecaploid species (S India and Sri Lanka). Plants from closer to the type locality of Mauritius, in Réunion, were dodecaploid. Because specimens from the Hainan populations have the same ploidy level (12x), we use the name A. affine following Sledges (Bull. Brit. Mus. (Nat. Hist.), Bot. 3: 235-277. 1965) concept, based on morphological and cytological study. Mature A. affine plants can be very similar to juvenile specimens of A. pseudolaserpitiifolium and its relatives.
242305800 | 西部铁角蕨 xi bu tie jiao jue 
242305800 | Asplenium atuntzeense Viane & Reichstein; A. daghestanicum Christ subsp. aitchisonii (Fraser-Jenkins & Reichstein) Fraser-Jenkins; A. minutum Chang Y. Yang (1993), not Willdenow ex Klotsch (1847); A. subdigitatum Ching (1985), not Mettenius ex Kuhn (1868); A. xinjiangense Ching.
242305800 | Plants 8-18 cm tall. Rhizome short, erect to ascending, apex scaly; scales dark brown, ovate-triangular, 2-4 mm, often with marginal fimbriae. Fronds caespitose, bright to dark green, (2-)7-11(-15) cm; stipe usually as long as (up to 1/3 of) lamina, 2-6 cm, semiterete, base dark brown for 2-15 mm but green toward rachis, with narrow scales and uniseriate hairs, subglabrous when old; lamina narrowly triangular to ovate, base widest, (2-)3-6 × (0.5-)1-2(-3) cm, bipinnate at base, apex acute; pinnae 5-10 pairs, subopposite or alternate, basal pinnae with short stalks 0.5-2(-3) mm, upper pinnae sessile, basal pinnae usually largest, triangular to deltoid, 3-12(-18) × 3-10(-15) mm, apex obtuse, lowest pinnae 0.5-2 cm apart, each usually with 2 pinnules and broad, deeply pinnatifid apex, upper pinnae smaller, less divided and entire near apex; ultimate segments with cuneiform base and obtuse apex, margin dentate, with 3-5(-7) spreading teeth. Costa obvious but veins obscure, veins anadromously branching. Frond herbaceous, green to brown-green when dried, rachis semiterete, green, with narrow scales and uniseriate hairs; average guard cell length 56-61 µm. Sori submedian to median on subtending vein, confluent when mature, 2-3 mm; indusia membranous, repand to entire, opening toward costule or toward costa. Spores with lophate (costate to cristate) perispore, average exospore length 38-42 µm. Sexual hexaploid species: 2n = 216.
242305800 | On half-shaded, non-calcareous rocks; 1700-4200 m. S Gansu, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Xizang, Yunnan [Bhutan, N India, Nepal, Pakistan].
242305800 | Asplenium aitchisonii is similar to other members of the A. varians complex (i.e., A. altajense, A. kukkonenii, A. semivarians, A. tenuicaule, A. varians) and was often included in A. varians, e.g., by Beddome (Handb. Ferns Brit. India, 158. 1883), Hope (J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 13: 667. 1901), Stewart (Biologia 3: 133-164. 1957), and Stewart in Nasir and Ali (Fl. W. Pakistan, 18. 1972); however, it is usually widest at the base and has longer stomata and spores due to its higher number of chromosomes. This is an allohexaploid (not an octoploid as stated in the original description). Asplenium daghestanicum Christ, a tetraploid from the Caucasus and Libya (Tibesti), is genetically isolated from this species and thus better kept as a separate species. Plants from isolated populations, growing in sheltered conditions in regions with an extreme climate, are often less developed and have been described as separate species (i.e., A. xinjiangense, A. subdigitatum, A. minutum).
242305801 | 阿尔泰铁角蕨 a er tai tie jiao jue 
242305801 | Asplenium sarelii Hooker ["saulii"] f. altajense Komarov, Izv. Imp. Bot. Sada Petra Velikago 16: 150. 1916; A. chingianum Chang Y. Yang.
242305801 | Plants 5-15 cm tall. Rhizome erect, short, apex scaly; scales dark brown to black, narrowly triangular, 2-3.5 × 0.3-0.5 mm, entire. Fronds caespitose; stipe 2.5-3.5(-6) cm, base scaly and brown abaxially, green upward, adaxially green, sulcate, subglabrous; lamina 2-pinnatifid to 2-pinnate, narrowly triangular-ovate, 8-9 × 2-2.5 cm, base slightly reduced, apex acute; pinnae (5-)10-15 pairs, lower pinnae subopposite, often deltoid-flabellate or almost orbicular, upper alternate and gradually fused into 0.5-1 cm pinnatifid apex, second to fourth pair usually largest, stalk up to 1 mm and adaxially sulcate with raised supravascular ridge, middle pinnae triangular-ovate, ca. 11 × 8-10 mm, base asymmetrical, acroscopic side truncate, basiscopic side cuneate, 1-pinnate, apex obtuse; pinnules 2 or 3 pairs, anadromous, basal acroscopic pinnule free, largest, subovate, 4-5 × 2-4 mm, base cuneate, other pinnules adnate to costa and confluent into pinna apex, margins dentate-serrate, apex obtuse. Veins obscure, flabellately anadromous, slightly raised adaxially. Fronds papery, green to grayish green when dry, lamina subglabrous, average stomatal guard cell length 44-48 µm; rachis semiterete, green, adaxially sulcate and with raised supravascular ridge. Sori 2-4 per pinnule, basal to medial on pinnae, at maturity confluent, linear-elliptic, 1-2.5 mm; indusia grayish green, linear-elliptic, membranous, entire, opening toward costa or costules. Spores with lophate (cristate) perispore, average exospore length 32-34 µm. Plants sexual, allotetraploid: 2n = 144.
242305801 | In crevices of shaded rocks; 400-1500 m. Nei Mongol, Ningxia, Sichuan, Xinjiang [Mongolia, Russia (Altai, S Siberia)].
242305801 | Asplenium altajense is relatively common in the area bordering China, the Altai Mountains, Mongolia, and Russia, but future research will have to show if the area given by Grubov (Rast. Tsentral. Azii 1: 82. 1963) is correct. In general shape, this taxon is similar to A. pekinense Hance. However, most pinnae of A. altajense have only the basal acroscopic pinnule free, the others are confluent and form the pinna apex, while in A. pekinense several segments are free or just slightly adnate to the costa. The stipe is less scaly in A. altajense, and its texture is more herbaceous. Asplenium altajense is also similar to A. tenuicaule, from which it can be distinguished by the more narrow and acute teeth (obtuse to mucronate in A. tenuicaule). Due to confusion between A. tenuicaule, A. pekinense, and A. anogrammoides, the distribution of this taxon is not well known. Asplenium chingianum (type fragment in IBSC!) is a submature plant with immature sporangia, few and unripe spores, and almost no scales; it is also similar to A. nesii specimens from N Pakistan. The hybrid between A. altajense and A. tenuicaule is relatively common where they grow together.

242305807 | Asplenium leiboense Ching; A. sarelii Hooker var. anogrammoides (Christ) Tagawa; A. sepulchrale Hooker, p.p.
242305807 | Plants 10-30 cm tall. Rhizome short, erect or ascending, apex scaly; scales dark brown to black, narrowly triangular, 3-8 × 0.3-0.7 mm, margins denticulate; scale base hyaline, cordate, with numerous yellow-brown, unicellular hairs 1-5 × ca. 0.02 mm, similar to root hairs. Fronds caespitose; stipe 7-15 cm, semiterete, dark brown abaxially or becoming green toward rachis, upward green, adaxially green, shallowly sulcate with supravascular ridge, with similar scales as on rhizome, reduced hairlike scales toward rachis or subglabrous; lamina ovate, 6-13 × 2.5-7(-8) cm, base truncate, apex acute, tripinnatifid-tripinnate; pinnae 8-12 pairs, basal pairs subopposite to alternate, stalk 2-4 mm, sulcate adaxially; several basal pinnae pairs ± equal in length, ovate-triangular, 1.5-3 × 0.5-1.5 cm, base nearly symmetrical, truncate to broadly cuneate, 2-pinnatifid-bipinnate, apex acute; pinnules 4-6 pairs, anadromous, acroscopic and basiscopic pinnules ± equal in size, narrowly triangular to ovate, 5-10 × 3-6 mm, base asymmetrical, acroscopic side truncate, basiscopic side cuneate, largest pinnules stalked, others decurrent on costa, pinnatipartite-pinnate, apex acute; segments 2 or 3 pairs, linear to narrow elliptic, apex with 2 or 3 teeth. Costa sulcate adaxially, without median ridge, veins slightly raised adaxially, anadromously forked. Fronds firmly herbaceous, green to grayish green, lamina subglabrous, average stomatal guard cell length 48-52 µm; rachis green, semiterete, abaxially green or base castaneous becoming green toward apex, adaxially sulcate with raised median supravascular ridge, with reduced scales or subglabrous. Sori 2-4 per ultimate segment, median to subterminal on acroscopic vein, subconfluent at maturity, subelliptic, 1-2.5 mm; indusia grayish green, subelliptic, membranous, entire, opening toward costule or central veinlet, persistent. Spores brown, perispore lophate (cristate), average exospore length 33-36 µm. Plants sexual, allotetraploids: 2n = 144.

242305807 | Asplenium anogrammoides is an (allo)tetraploid (Kurita, J. Jap. Bot. 35: 269-272. 1960; Mitui, Sci. Rep. Tokyo Kyoiku Daigaku, B, 13: 285-333. 1968) and originated via chromosome doubling in the sterile hybrid between A. sarelii and A. tenuicaule (Lin & Sleep in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 111-127. 1989; Murakami et al., Amer. Fern J. 89: 232-243. 1999; Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003; Wang, Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 1-14. 2003). Their morphological similarity led to much confusion and misapplication of the name A. sarelii to this taxon (also called "tetraploid sarelii") (e.g., Christensen, Acta Horti Gothob. 1: 41-110. 1924; Ogata, Icon. Fil. Jap. 1: t. 8. 1928; Tardieu, Asplén. Tonkin, 46. 1932; Ching, Icon. Fil. Sin. 3: t. 111. 1935, p.p.; Fl. Pl. Herb. Chin. Bor.-Or. 1: 37. 1958; De Vol, Mus. Heude. Notes Bot.

Moreover, less-divided plants of A. anogrammoides are similar to large plants of A. pekinense (the autotetraploid arisen from A. sarelii).
242305807 | On the other hand, the name Asplenium anogrammoides has been misapplied (e.g., Komarov, Izv. Imp. S.-Peterburgsk. Bot. Sada 16: 145-151. 1916; Komarov & Klobukova-Alisova, Opred. Rast. Dalnevost. Kraia 1: 82. 1931; Fomin, Fl. Sibir. Orient. Extremi 5: 152-154. 1930; in Komarov & Iljin, Fl. URSS 1: 68. 1934; Ching, loc. cit.: 37. 1958) to S Siberian and Mongolian A. tenuicaule var. subvarians.
242305807 | Yellow-brown (root)hairs are present on the rhizome, stipe base, and scale base of Asplenium altajense, A. anogrammoides, A. pekinense, A. sarelii, A. tenuicaule, and other related taxa, and thus cannot be used to distinguish them. The average exospore and stomata length are the most reliable characters discriminating between diploid and tetraploids in this complex. Asplenium anogrammoides can often be separated from A. pekinense by its largely not-reduced lamina base and its ovate-triangular (vs. deltoid) pinnae with stalks 2-4 mm (vs. 0.5-2 mm).
242305807 | Where Asplenium anogrammoides grows together with A. tenuicaule, their sterile triploid hybrid, A. ×mitsutae, is common. Asplenium ×mitsutae Viane & Reichstein, nothosp. nov. Type: China. Sichuan: Qingcheng Shan, ca. 70 km WNW of Chengdu, mixed evergreen forest with Rhododendron, on wall inside temple yard together with A. anogrammoides and A. tenuicaule, 1050 m, 16 Sep 1988, Viane 4046-B (= TR-7177) (holotype, GENT). Planta hybrida, inter parentes A. anogrammoides et A. tenuicaule quoad divisionem laminae atque pinnularum segmentorumque formam necnon dimensiones cellularum accessoriarum stomatum intermedia, ab eis sporis abortivis necnon chromosomatum numero triploideo (2n = 108, meiose bivalentibus univalentibusque 36) differt. Meiotic chromosome behavior in this hybrid shows that A. anogrammoides contains one chromosome set of A. tenuicaule. This hybrid is named after S. Mitsuta, who collected it for us in Japan with several other living plants in 1985. Asplenium sarelii var. magnum H. S. Kung, described from Sichuan, is probably the same hybrid combination.
242305807 | "Asplenium wudangense" (Z. R. Wang & X. Hou, Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 4. 2003) belongs here but was not validly published because no Latin description or diagnosis, or reference to such, was provided (Melbourne Code, Art. 39.1).

242305815 | Asplenium asterolepis is similar, and perhaps conspecific, to A. crinicaule but has smaller, more oblong pinnae. Its scales are deltoid-tridentate with a very long central apical tail, as those of A. crinicaule. At present, this taxon seems to be known only from the type collection and may represent just a local variant of A. crinicaule.

242305818 | Plants of Asplenium austrochinense from Guangdong are octoploid like the Japanese (Shimura & Takiguchi, J. Jap. Bot. 54: 311-318. 1979), and scales are similar in Chinese and Japanese specimens. Upon drought stress, the margins of the frond tend to roll inward, protecting the abaxial epidermis with the stomata. The name A. consimile Ching was used to describe plants with a somewhat thinner lamina.

200004107 | Asplenium bullatum was confused with A. bulbiferum G. Forster by, e.g., Hooker (Sp. Fil. 3: 196. 1860) p.p., Beddome (Ferns Brit. India 1: 65. 1865; Handb. Ferns Brit. India, 159. 1883), Clarke (Trans. Linn. Soc. London, Bot. 1: 485. 1880), Christensen (Index Filic. 103. 1905) p.p., Panigrahi (Bull. Bot. Surv. India 2: 313. 1960), and Ching and Wu (Fl. Xizang. 1: 184. 1983).
200004107 | Plants of Asplenium bullatum from Nepal are octoploid (Matsumoto & Nakaike in Watanabe & Malla, Cryptog. Himalayas 1: 179. 1988), unlike the tetraploids known from the E Himalaya (Bir, Curr. Sci. 29: 446. 1960). Further studies are needed to find out possible correlations with the dissection of the lamina, which varies from 2-pinnate to 4-pinnatifid, and with the more divided forms considered typical and recognized as A. bullatum var. bullatum (大盖铁角蕨(原变种) da gai tie jiao jue (yua bian zhong)). Bipinnate forms have been called A. bullatum var. shikokianum (Makino) Ching & S. H. Wu (FRPS 4(2): 75. 1999; 稀羽铁角蕨 xi yu tie jiao jue). However, A. ×shikokianum Makino (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 13: 13. 1899, pro sp., described from Japan) is the name for the natural hexaploid (Shimura & Matsumoto, J. Jap. Bot. 51: 235-244. 1976) hybrid between A. wrightii and A. ritoense and should not be used to describe the less-divided forms of A. bullatum (e.g., H. S. Kung, Fl. Sichuan. 6: 381. 1988; Wu, FRPS 4(2): 75. 1999; P. S. Wang & X. Y. Wang, Pterid. Fl. Guizhou, 139. 2001, p.p.; Li, Fl. Hunan 1: 288. 2004, p.p.). Many specimens currently filed in Chinese herbaria as A. shikokianum or as A. bullatum var. shikokianum have good spores and are not hybrids. True A. ×shikokianum is not uncommon where its parents grow together (e.g., Guizhou, Taiwan). Asplenium ×wangii C. M. Kuo (Bot. Bull. Acad. Sin. 29: 109-111. 1988), the hybrid between A. bullatum and A. wrightii, is morphologically similar to A. ×shikokianum and could be confused. Asplenium ×wangii was described from Taiwan and may be present where the parent taxa grow together (Fujian, Guizhou, Hunan, Sichuan, Taiwan, and Yunnan).

242305832 | Asplenium capillipes is the smallest species of the genus in China and may be overlooked since it often grows hidden among moss. It is reported from Gansu (Tianshui), Hunan, and Shaanxi (Tibia Shan), but we have seen no specimens; however, it should be noted that large plants of this species are similar to small plants of A. tenuicaule and may be confused with it. Identification of vouchers from Bhutan (Itô in H. Hara, Fl. E. Himalaya, 486-489. 1966) needs verification since some belong to A. fugax, which has a flagelliform apex in contrast to A. capillipes. Plants growing in thick moss cushions may have stipes up to 9 cm. Asplenium capillipes is diploid with n = 36II during meiosis (Mitui, J. Jap. Bot. 45: 84-90. 1970) and 2n = 72 chromosomes in vegetative cells. It is remarkable that it has only 32 relatively large spores per sporangium.

250098327 | We consider Asplenium castaneoviride to be a good species, not a sterile hybrid (Ching & Iwatsuki, J. Jap. Bot. 57: 129-132. 1982) because Lovis et al. (Brit. Fern Gaz. 10: 263-268. 1972) and Lin and Sleep (in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 111-127. 1989) have shown that this is a fertile allotetraploid, which originated via chromosome doubling in the sterile hybrid between A. ruprechtii and A. incisum.

250098322 | Plants 8-15 cm tall. Rhizome shortly creeping to ascending, apex scaly; scales dark brown, narrowly triangular to subulate, entire to denticulate, at base fimbriate. Fronds caespitose; stipe shiny castaneous only at base, abruptly green toward rachis, 6-10 cm, 2-3 × as long as lamina, with unicellular glands or subglabrous, apex 2- or 3-forked; segments linear, 2-3 × 0.1-0.15 cm, base gradually decurrent onto stipe, minutely forked again at apex.

250098322 | Asplenium caucasicum is the diploid ancestor of the more common autotetraploid A. septentrionale (see below). This taxon is best known from the Caucasus region, but microcharacters have shown its presence in Xinjiang. A recent chromosome count from Xizang confirms its presence in China. A doubling of its genome has led to the origin of autotetraploid A. septentrionale. In places where both taxa grow together, their triploid sterile hybrid, A. ×dirense Viane & Reichstein, can be expected.
250098322 | Asplenium sasakii (Hayata) Makino & Nemoto was distinguished from A. septentrionale by its narrower fronds (a.o., Tagawa, Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 10: 204-205. 1941); it may be an earlier name for A. caucasicum if Taiwanese plants turn out to be diploid. However, at present, no chromosome counts or flow-cytometric data are available for Taiwanese plants.

250098329 | Asplenium ceterach is widely distributed in S Europe and was often put into the separate genus Ceterach Willdenow (Anleit. Selbststud. Bot. 578. 1804, nom. cons.; 药蕨属 yao jue shu) on the basis of its peculiar pinnatipartite fronds, submarginally anastomosing veins, and the dense, abaxial scale covering. However, all these characters also occur in other clades within the family, and molecular studies (Van den heede et al., Amer. J. Bot. 90: 481-495. 2003) have shown that "Ceterach" consists of two separate clades both nested within Aspleniaceae and not meriting generic status. This species is autotetraploid; its diploid ancestor (A. javorkeanum Vida), from which it can be distinguished by its larger spores, is only known from the Mediterranean area.

Perispore costate, with average exospore length 40-44 (dodecaploids). Plants sexual polyploid: 2n = 144, 288, or 432.
200004114 | On rocks at streamsides, in forests; 100-3000 m. Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan [India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam; Australia].
200004114 | Tetraploid plants (n = 72) of Asplenium crinicaule were reported from India (Bir, Curr. Sci. 29: 445-447. 1960), but in China, this is an aggregate of octo- and dodecaploid taxa. At present, octoploids are known from S India (Kuriachan, Cytologia 32: 500-506. 1968), Sichuan (Wang in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 133-134. 1989), Guangdong, and Guizhou, and dodecaploids from Guizhou and Guangdong.
200004114 | Plants are variable in frond and pinna shape, even at the type locality at Dinghu Shan, Guangdong, where the species is dodecaploid. Members of this aggregate are similar to Asplenium pellucidum Lamarck, which is octoploid in Réunion, but has more narrow pinnae with an acuminate apex and many strongly reduced basal pinnae. Asplenium horridum Kaulfuss has similar scales. We prefer to treat this taxon as an aggregate species until the ploidy of plants at the different type localities is better known.
200004114 | The name Asplenium adiantoides (here treated as a synonym of A. aethiopicum) was misapplied to this species by Y. C. Wu et al. (Bull. Dept. Biol. Sun Yatsen Univ. 3: t. 88-89. 1932).

233500192 | Asplenium dalhousiae is a relatively common W Himalayan fern expected to occur in Xizang as it has been reported for Nepal (Roy et al., Brit. Fern Gaz. 10: 194. 1971); it is recorded provisionally in the Flora. This and the following three taxa (A. paucivenosum, A. magnificum, A. qiujiangense) were often included in the genus Ceterachopsis (J. Smith) Ching (Bull. Fan Mem. Inst. Biol., Bot. 10: 8. 1940; 苍山蕨 属 cang shan jue shu) on the basis of their peculiar frond morphology. The group consists of four or five species, mainly from the subtropical mountains of SW China, and one (A. dalhousiae) more widely distributed taxon. Recent studies have confirmed that this clade does not merit generic rank.

250098337 | Contrary to previous reports, new and more extensive research in S Europe has shown that there are no gross morphological differences between Asplenium dolomiticum and A. ruta-muraria (see below). Asplenium deqenense and A. suborbiculare, both with an average exospore length of 39-40 µm, are considered juvenile, depauperate forms of A. dolomiticum. Small juvenile forms with simple or ternate fronds are not rare in populations of both A. ruta-muraria and A. dolomiticum.

200004122 | Plants of Asplenium ensiforme with extremely narrow fronds, occurring at higher elevations, have sometimes been recognized as a separate species, variety, or form. A specimen from Taiwan with forked frond apices was described as "A. bicuspe" (nom. nud., cited in the protologue of Diplazium bicuspe), and we have seen such aberrant forked forms also from Yunnan. Forked fronds occur in all species of pteridophytes, often randomly in particular plants, and do not merit taxonomic status.
200004122 | Plants from India were reported to be tetraploid (n = 72) by Mehra and Bir (Curr. Sci. 26: 151-152. 1957) and by Bir (Curr. Sci. 29: 445-447. 1960; Curr. Sci. 31: 248-250. 1962; Caryologia 18: 107-115. 1965). This species is similar to Asplenium holosorum; for differences, see below that species.

200004125 | Large specimens of Asplenium exiguum are similar to well-developed plants of A. nesii and can best be distinguished by the presence of gemmae in the apical notch of the pinnae.
200004125 | Asplenium exiguum is an autotetraploid taxon that most probably originated via chromosome doubling in diploid A. lushanense. It is a variable species with an easily overlooked, tiny bud in the sinus at the pinna apex, well illustrated in Ching (Icon. Filic. Sin. 4: pl. 174, 2b. 1937). The morphological variability, both within China and throughout the Himalaya, is relatively large, though mainly restricted to size differences. Growing conditions may strongly influence frond length and the shape of pinnae (from almost oblong to triangular). In some populations (S India, China, Philippines), the rachis is flagelliform and terminates in a slender tail with a terminal budlet. This variation led to much confusion and the description of several (local) species, e.g., A. glenniei, A. loherianum, A. moupinense, A. woodsioides, and A. yunnanense. Asplenium moupinense var. dareiforme represents a luxurious, well-developed plant that does not differ in any essential character from other members of this group. Since there are no fundamental morphological, nor cytological, differences between these taxa, we treat them as synonyms of tetraploid A. exiguum following Hope (Bull. Torrey Bot. Club 26: 58-62. 1899; J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 13: 657-671. 1901), Ching (Icon. Filic. Sin. 4: pl. 174. 1937), Maxon (Amer. Fern J. 28: 141. 1938), Tagawa (Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 8: 91-100. 1939), Tagawa and Iwatsuki (in Smitinand et al., Fl. Thailand 3(2): 261-291. 1985), and Mickel and Smith (Pterid. Mexico, 94. 2004). The diploid and tetraploid species within this complex can be separated by microcharacters (Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 91-94. 2003): Asplenium lushanense (diploid) with an average exospore length of 24-28 µm and stomata 32-40 µm, and tetraploid A. exiguum with average exospore length of 30-36 µm and stomata 43-52 µm. Where both species grow together (China, Nepal, Vietnam), their sterile triploid hybrid, with aborted spores, an intermediate morphology, and often showing hybrid vigor, is common. Asplenium ×mickelii Viane & Reichstein, nothosp. nov. Type: China. Yunnan: Kunming, Xishan, Longman, ca. 2120 m, on steep limestone cliff, under forest, 29 Sep 1986, Z. R. Wang & M. Chu C806-b1 (=TR-6605-b1) (holotype, PE). Planta hybrida, inter parentes A. exiguum et A. lushanense quoad divisionem laminae atque dimensiones cellularum accessoriarum stomatum intermedia, ab eis sporis abortivis necnon chromosomatum numero triploideo (2n = 108, meiose trivalentibus 0-4, bivalentibus 32-36 et univalentibus 29-36) differt. This hybrid is named after J. Mickel, who collected it in Mexico (Oaxaca: Destrito Ixtlán, 16 Sep 1972, J. T. Mickel & L. Pardue 6488-A [NY]) and sent us living plants for our research on the A. exiguum complex.
200004125 | From their changing concept of this complex, it is not clear if Fraser-Jenkins, Pangtey and Khullars Asplenium exiguum nothosubsp. luyunense Z. R. Wang ex Fraser-Jenkins, Pangtey & Khullar (Indian Fern J. 27(1-2): 198. 2011), a validation at the subspecific level of "A. ×luyunense" (Wang, Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 11. 2003, nom. nud.), also refers to this hybrid.

200004127 | Asplenium finlaysonianum is a Himalayan species with a typical morphology and venation pattern unlike any other taxon in the family. Though Bir (Curr.

242305870 | Specimens of Asplenium formosae with sterile simple fronds are similar to A. scortechinii, but their fronds have an even to repand margin (notched in A. scortechinii) and a more prominent midrib. Asplenium loriceum is a superfluous new name because the epithets "formosae" and "formosanum" should not be regarded as homonyms.
242305870 | Asplenium loriceum var. karapinense (Hayata) Tagawa (Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 2: 200. 1933; "Diplazium makinoi var. karapinense" Hayata, Icon. Pl. Formosan. 5: 272. 1915), described from Taiwan, is sometimes treated as a synonym of this species. The epithet for Asplenium makinoi was taken from "Diplazium makinoi" (Yabe, Enum. Pl. Formosa, 600. 1906), which is a nomen nudum and was not therefore validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)).

242305873 | Asplenium fugax is easily overlooked as it is a small species hidden in moss cushions under boulders. Plants are often identified or reported as A. capillipes (e.g., Itô in H. Hara, Fl. E. Himalaya, 486-489. 1966; Nakaike, Bull. Natl. Sci. Mus., Tokyo, B, 12: 37-54. 1986), but that taxon never has a flagelliform apex. Christ (Bull. Soc. Bot. France 52(Mém. 1): 1-69. 1905) cited two syntypes: one collection by Delavay and another by Farges, both kept in Paris (P). Delavays gathering is a mixture mounted on three separate sheets numbered 1, 2, and 3. Most plants fit Christs description and belong to A. fugax, but there is also a Woodsia specimen on sheet 2. Plant "7" on sheet 1 (bearing Delavays original label) is well pressed, the most fertile and best developed, and it is selected here as lectotype. The other syntype (Sichuan [Chongqing], Tchen-kéou-tin, 2000 m, August, Farges 657 [P!]) belongs to A. capillipes.

242305891 | Asplenium holosorum is similar to A. ensiforme but generally grows at lower elevations. Its fronds are more herbaceous and their midrib (rachis) is flat near the apex but raised adaxially in the lower half of the frond and not sulcate. Both species have a similar epidermis structure with cryptopolocytic to basipolocytic (also called anomocytic, staurocytic, or cyclocytic) stomata. In both taxa, the outer free margin of the indusium consists of translucent cells with very thin walls, but this marginal rim is narrow (ca. 2 cell layers) in A. holosorum, but more elaborate and dentate-fimbriate in A. ensiforme.
242305891 | No chromosome counts seem to be available, but our recent FCM results suggest this taxon is probably hexaploid.

242305893 | Asplenium indicum is a sexual tetraploid plant in India, the Himalaya (Mehra & Bir, Curr. Sci. 26: 151-152. 1957; Bir, Curr. Sci. 29: 445-447. 1960; Curr. Sci. 31: 248-250. 1962; Caryologia 18: 107-115. 1965), and China (Guizhou, Xizang). It is morphologically very variable and similar to A. yoshinagae with which it is often united to form an aggregate taxon. Because they are genetically isolated and form sterile hybrids when growing together, we treat these taxa as separate species. In China, A. indicum is usually a smaller plant, with smaller spores and stomata than A. yoshinagae, from which it can also be distinguished by a chromosome count or flow-cytometry. The distinction based on the presence of gemmae is highly unreliable, at least in China, where all tetraploids checked were gemmiferous. The gemmae are formed on the pinna stalks, close to the rachis, rarely on the rachis itself. Another very similar taxon, A. gueinzianum, is also gemmiferous but produces buds on the surface of the pinnae. Due to confusion among these taxa, the exact distribution of this species is not well documented.

200004134 | Asplenium kansuense is a putative autotetraploid, which probably originated via chromosome doubling in A. tenuicaule var. tenuicaule. Its general morphology and perispore are very similar to those of that taxon, but its spore size indicates that it is probably tetraploid. No chromosome counts are available. In China, A. kansuense was often misidentified as A. varians or as A. sarelii s.l. Large tripinnate plants resemble tetraploid A. anogrammoides with which they share half of their genome.
200004134 | The S Indian (Nilgiri) plants belonging to this species (Asplenium fimbriatum var. leptophyllum) occur at higher elevations, are smaller than the Chinese plants, and are similar to both A. varians and A. semivarians. Several chromosome reports of S Indian "tetraploid Asplenium varians" may refer to this species. Large specimens of African A. fimbriatum Kunze are closely similar, also in perispore characters. Hybridization experiments have shown that true A. fimbriatum is an allotetraploid with the same genome composition as A. varians and is thus best considered a variety of the latter (Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003): Asplenium varians Wallich ex Hooker & Greville var. fimbriatum (Kunze) Viane stat. nov. (Basionym: Asplenium fimbriatum Kunze, Linnaea 18: 117. 1844; A. varians subsp. fimbriatum (Kunze) Schelpe).

200004135 | Asplenium kiangsuense is similar to a small form of A. normale but differs in its scales with wider central band of occluded cells, the adaxially flat rachis, the green rachis tip, the smaller and more elliptic pinnae, and the perispore. The green rachis tip and the pinna shape make it also similar to A. adulterinum Milde, from which it differs in the blacker and wider zone of occluded cell lumina of its scales. Due to confusion with A. normale, the distribution of this taxon is not well known.

250098323 | Due to the peculiar frond shape and double sori facing each other, both Asplenium komarovii and A. scolopendrium were often placed in the former satellite genus Phyllitis. Modern studies confirm that it deserves no recognition. The group consists of two species: a diploid ancestral taxon (2n = 72) essentially in Europe and an autotetraploid in North America (including Mexico) and NE Asia (Mitui, J. Jap. Bot. 41: 60-64. 1966; Sci. Rep. Tokyo Kyoiku Daigaku, B, 13: 285-333. 1968).
250098323 | Asplenium komarovii originated by chromosome doubling in diploid A. scolopendrium; in local floras it is usually mentioned under this latter name. In the absence of a chromosome count or flow cytometric data, it can best be distinguished from its ancestor by its larger mean exospore length (more than 31 µm).

Fronds caespitose; stipe green (small fronds) but base dark brown, color occasionally extending into rachis, (1-)2-6(-9) cm, with small dark brown, often linear scales and uniseriate hairs, subglabrous when old, adaxially sulcate; lamina narrowly oblong to ovate, (2.3-)5-10(-20) × (0.7-)1-2.5(-4) cm, base truncate-cuneate, bipinnate at base, pinnate-pinnatisect(-pinnatifid) in upper part, apex acute-acuminate to caudate; pinnae 7-13 pairs, alternate or opposite, stalk ca. 1 mm, lower pinnae slightly reduced, lowest pair 0.8-1.8 cm from next pair, more distal pinnae closer but usually not overlapping, median and upper pinnae often at an angle of 45°-75° to rachis, largest pinnae triangular-ovate, 10-20 × 5-10(-12) mm, base asymmetrical, acroscopic side truncate, basiscopic side cuneate, basal acroscopic pinnule largest, often shortly (ca. 0.5 mm) stipitate and nearly parallel to rachis, fan-shaped or ovate to triangular-ovate, margin serrate to crenate with acute to mucronate teeth, apex obtuse; basiscopic pinnules often adnate and directed outward, almost perpendicular to rachis.

250098343 | Asplenium kukkonenii is most similar to A. tenuicaule and A. varians. Crossing experiments and micromorphology have shown that A. tenuicaule is one of its ancestors (Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003). The second ancestor of A. kukkonenii is still unknown. The fact that A. kukkonenii and A. varians share a genome explains why these taxa are difficult to differentiate from each other. The lamina of A. kukkonenii is usually slightly narrower and more acuminate (occasionally even caudate) at the apex. The mean length of the rhizome scales is usually less than 3.5 mm in A. kukkonenii and more than 3.5 mm in A. varians. Reliable differentiation is also possible by examination of epidermal cells, which are thickened or pseudomamillate in their sinuses in A. kukkonenii, but not so in A. varians. In herbaria, A. kukkonenii is often identified as A. varians or as A. fontanum and was included in A. varians by, e.g., Beddome (Handb. Ferns Brit. India, 158. 1883), Hope (J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 13: 667. 1901), Stewart (Biologia 3: 133-164. 1957), Stewart in Nasir & Ali (Fl. W. Pakistan, 18. 1972), Nakaike and Malik Cryptog. Fl. Pakistan) 1: 270. 1992; Cryptog. Fl. Pakistan 2: 332. 1993), and G. F. Zhang (Fl. Yunnan. 20: 673. 2006).

250098332 | Asplenium lepturus is similar to A. polyodon but has more narrow and caudate pinnae, a widely creeping rhizome, and a peculiar perispore pattern. It shares these characters with a number of tropical taxa, e.g., A. contiguum Kaulfuss from Hawaii, the neotropical A. serra Langsdorff & Fisher, the African A. friesiorum C. Christensen group, and A. nitens Swartz from Réunion.

250098342 | ● Rock crevices; 400-1800 m. Liaoning, Nei Mongol (Da Xingan Ling), Shanxi.
250098342 | This species is named after Professor Yu-Quan Ma, principal editor of Flora Intramongolica.
250098342 | Asplenium mae is mainly known from the Da Xingan Ling. It is a putative autotetraploid which probably originated via chromosome doubling in A. tenuicaule var. subvarians, which it strongly resembles. Average spore size indicates that it is probably tetraploid, but no chromosome counts are yet available. In herbaria, A. mae is either filed under A. tenuicaule, A. subvarians, A. anogrammoides, or A. sarelii.
250098342 | Several names have been misapplied to this species, e.g., Asplenium subvarians by Ling et al. (in Liu, Fl. Shanxi. 1: 84-97. 1992), A. tenuicaule by Wu and Bai (Fl. Intramongol. 1: 49-117. 1985), and A. sarelii by Li and Wang (Fl. Liaoning 1: 73-79. 1988).

242305931 | ● Epiphytic or on rocks in forests; 400-700 m. Probably endemic to Taiwan.
242305931 | This rare species was confused with Asplenium vulcanicum Blume in De Vol and Kuo (Fl. Taiwan 1: 491. 1975). More recently, A. matsumurae was treated as a synonym of S Indian A. serricula Fée (Kuo, Taiwania 30: 37. 1985; Shieh et al., Fl. Taiwan, ed. 2, 1: 461. 1994; Knapp, Ferns Fern Allies Taiwan, 48, 55. 2011), but that species has a more creeping rhizome, fewer pinnae, and a terminal pinna perfectly conform with the lateral ones. Asplenium matsumurae is also superficially similar to members of the A. wrightii complex, but it differs in its venation pattern with the first basal basiscopic vein lacking and more distal veins simple (not forked), its terminal pinna relatively similar to the subapical lateral pinnae, and its indusia not rolling back at maturity.

Fronds subleathery, grayish green when dry; rachis blackish purple to blackish brown, shiny, abaxially terete, upper part of adaxial side shallowly sulcate and with 2 rows of relatively closely set fingerlike projections forming low ridge (often eroded and not easily visible on older fronds), occasionally with scaly bud in axil of lowest pinna. Sori 2-7 per pinna, linear or linear-elliptic, 1-2.5 mm, medial on subtending vein; indusia grayish brown, linear-elliptic, membranous, entire-sinuate, opening toward costa. Spores with lophate perispore, average exospore length 31-35 µm.
242305937 | ● On rocks in forests; ca. 2000 m. Yunnan.
242305937 | Asplenium microtum is similar to A. trichomanes and A. quadrivalens but clearly differs by the fingerlike papillae bordering the wings on the rachis. A similar wing structure is also found in A. glanduliserrulatum and A. humistratum, from which it differs by its gemmiferous rachis. However, not all plants have gemmae, and these species are kept separate, pending future research on this complex. The Mexican A. hallbergii Mickel & Beitel, which has a similar rachis but with papillae more perpendicular to the wing, is perhaps distantly related.

242305947 | Asplenium neovarians, known from few collections, needs more study. Based on the length of its stomata and exospore, it should at least be tetraploid. It is similar to A. altajense (but different in its more distinct apical pinna), A. aitchisonii (but different in its putative ploidy level), and A. kukkonenii, and from all of which it differs in perispore morphology.

Sori 2-4 per pinnule, basal to submedian on subtending vein and thus close to costa or costule, confluent at maturity, linear, 1-1.5 mm; indusia grayish brown to whitish, linear-elliptic, membranous, entire, opening toward costa or costules. Spores with lophate (costate) perispore. Plants tetraploid: 2n = 144.

200004148 | Asplenium nesii is similar to larger forms of A. exiguum, but its pinna apices are without gemmae, the stipe is green toward the rachis, and the rachis itself is usually entirely green. Asplenium barkamense is a luxurious form from Sichuan, but locally not rare in Xizang. Type specimens of A. ×mainlingense Ching & S. K. Wu (Fl. Xizang 1: 184. 1983, pro sp.) are hybrids with aborted spores. They probably represent a cross between A. nesii and A. varians or A. tenuicaule, which all occur in the area close to the type locality near Mainling, Xizang.

242305949 | Plants 1-1.2 m tall. Rhizome erect, thick and short, woody, apex scaly; scales dark to purplish brown, narrowly triangular to linear-subulate, margin ciliate to fimbriate. Fronds caespitose; stipe pale brown, up to 5 cm, woody, when dry semiterete abaxially, base densely scaly; lamina lanceolate, 90-120 × (8-) 9-15 cm, gradually decurrent on stipe, base cuneate, margin entire, apex acute to acuminate. Midrib raised and semiterete on upper adaxial side but flat abaxially, subglabrous, grayish to pale brown; veinlets simple or forked, parallel and connected at their apex to marginal vein. Fronds papery or thinly leathery, when dry grayish green, glabrous. Sori linear, 3-5 cm, on acroscopic side of veinlets, running from near their base up to 1/2 of their length; basal part of lamina usually sterile; indusia brownish, linear, thickly membranous, entire, persistent.

242305949 | Asplenium nidus is accepted here in a broad sense and constitutes a species complex (e.g., Murakami et al. in M. Kato, Biol. Biodivers. 53-66. 1999; Yatabe et al., Amer. J. Bot. 88: 1517-1522. 2001). The variability of its frond and perispore morphology (e.g., Wei & Dong, Nordic J. Bot. 30: 90-103. 2012), as well as other phenetic characters, is not well studied in relation to its molecular diversity.
242305949 | Asplenium setoi N. Murakami & Serizawa, recently described from Japan, might be present at low elevations in China (Taiwan); typical specimens can be distinguished from A. nidus by their keeled to boat-shaped midrib. Another species regularly confused with both A. setoi and A. nidus is the often cultivated A. australasicum (J. Smith) Hooker, a South Pacific taxon.
242305949 | Based on their particular venation pattern, taxa resembling Asplenium nidus have been recognized as a separate section (A. sect. Thamnopteris Hooker & Baker), a subgenus (A. subg. Thamnopteris C. Presl), or as a genus of its own (Neottopteris J. Smith; syn. Thamnopteris (C. Presl) C. Presl). Plants are often epiphytes with large simple fronds growing in a close spiral and forming the typical birds nest. Veins departing from the midrib (rachis) fork anadromously, run almost parallel and straight to the margin where they connect to a common submarginal vein. However, recent molecular studies do not support the separation of this group as a separate genus. The clade consists of 15-30 species, and modern research shows that more taxa may await description. A critical revision of the group is urgently needed. Members occur mainly in rain forests of tropical Asia and the Pacific. A few taxa are widely cultivated as house plants and sold as "birds-nest fern." Many plants in commerce belong to A. australasicum, which can be distinguished from true A. nidus by its abaxially dark brown carinate midrib.

200004149 | In this Asplenium normale aggregate, three distinct taxa have been distinguished on the basis of the presence or absence of one to several buds on the rachis. At the tip of many fronds of typical A. normale sits a single gemma, often developed into a small plant. Plants without such buds have been described as A. normale var. boreale or A. boreale, though the oldest name for non-gemmiferous plants would probably have to be A. minus (PRC!). The name A. shimurae, or A. normale var. shimurae, is used for plants with many gemmae per frond. Sterile hybrids between these taxa are known from Japan, and their flavonoid patterns are different. All three morphotypes occur in China (A. shimurae mainly in Yunnan), next to intermediate hybrids.
200004149 | In this aggregate, diploid (China (Taiwan), S India, Malaysia, Nepal) and tetraploid chromosome numbers have been reported. Though Bir (Curr. Sci. 29: 446. 1960) and Nakaike (Bull. Natl. Sci. Mus., Tokyo, B, 12: 37-54. 1986) mainly reported tetraploids for the E Himalaya, and Wang (in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 133-134. 1989) for China, we found tetraploid, hexaploid, and octoploid plants, next to hybrids with intermediate ploidy.
200004149 | Most of the typical gemmiferous plants of Asplenium normale are tetraploid, have scales with a central line of cells with more thickened and darker walls than the more marginal cells, have a deep furrow flanked by relatively broad and rounded edges at the adaxial side of the rachis, and lack the first basiscopic vein departing from the costa. Such tetraploid plants, as well as type material of A. multijugum from Nepal, have an average exospore length of 26-30 µm. The absence of a basiscopic vein is a character A. normale shares with Hymenasplenium, in which two or more such veins are lacking.
200004149 | Several morphologically similar plants have scales with the lumina of the central cells occluded and opaque (costate-opaque scales as in e.g., Asplenium trichomanes and A. kiangsuense), a shallow furrow or a flat rachis bordered by a narrow sharp rim (as in A. kiangsuense, not a wing as in A. trichomanes), and usually possess the first basiscopic vein on the costa. Sterile morphologically intermediates between these plants and true A. normale are known from Guangdong. Because no clear correlations were found between the different ploidy levels (4x, 6x, 8x) and the morphotypes called A. normale, A. boreale, and A. shimurae, we refrain from recognizing them as species.

250098325 | Asplenium oblanceolatum is similar to other members of the A. nidus complex but differs from all by its echinate perispores (Holttum, Gard. Bull. Singapore 27: 143-154. 1974; Y. L. Zhang et al., Sporae Pterid. Sin. 240-263. 1976; Wei & Dong, Nordic J. Bot. 30: 90-103. 2012). In addition, it differs from small A. nidus by its midrib structure and from A. phyllitidis and A. antiquum by its narrower scales.
250098325 | We were unable to locate and study the type of Asplenium anguineum Christ (J. Bot. (Morot), ser. 2, 1: 265. 1908) from Vietnam; if this has echinate spores, it would be the oldest name for A. oblanceolatum/A. phyllitidis subsp. malesicum.

242305963 | Asplenium paucivenosum is a tetraploid species similar to the diploid A. dalhousiae but has much larger spores (and stomata) with a mean exospore length over 40 µm (less than 35 µm in A. dalhousiae) and a different, more fenestrate outer perispore. According to Nakaike (Ferns Nepal 2: 45, 1986), it was confused with A. dalhousiae by Itô (in H. Hara, Fl. E. Himal. 1: 487. 1966; Fl. E. Himal. 2: 214. 1971) and Iwatsuki (in Ohashi, Fl. E. Himal. 3: 194. 1975). It is even more easily confused with A. magnificum which has a larger mean exospore length (48 µm in A. paucivenosum vs. 52 µm in A. magnificum). In critical cases, a chromosome count is needed for identification.

200004153 | Asplenium pekinense is an autotetraploid (Mitui, J. Jap. Bot. 40: 117-124. 1965; Lin & Sleep in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 111-127. 1989; Wang, Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 1-14. 2003) species arisen by chromosome doubling in diploid A. sarelii. Allotetraploid A. anogrammoides is very similar because true A. sarelii is one of its ancestors, the second being A. tenuicaule (Lin & Sleep, loc. cit.). Reticulate hybridizations between diploid A. tenuicaule, A. sarelii, and A. semivarians led to the evolution of many confusingly similar taxa defying description. These can be grouped into the A. pekinense-complex consisting of A. altajense, A. anogrammoides, A. pekinense, and A. sarelii, and the A. varians group containing A. aitchisonii, A. kukkonenii, A. semivarians, and A. varians. Their close relationship and similarity has led to many wrong identifications, as well as incorrect and unreliable citations. In many places where A. pekinense grows with A. anogrammoides, their sterile tetraploid hybrid is relatively common. Asplenium ×kidoi Sleep ex Viane, Y. X. Lin & Reichstein, nothosp. nov. Type: China. Hebei: ca. 20 km NW of Beijing, Xiangshan park, natural pine forest above Fragrant Hill Hotel, among grasses on shaded hillside with A. anogrammoides, A. pekinense, and Athyrium niponicum (Mettenius) Hance, 190 m, 27 Sep 1997, Viane 7047 (holotype, GENT). Planta hybrida, inter parentes A. anogrammoides et A. pekinense quoad divisionem laminae atque pinnularum segmentorumque formam necnon dimensiones cellularum accessoriarum stomatum intermedia, ab eis sporis abortivis necnon chromosomatum numero tetraploideo (2n = 144, meiose trivalentium bivalentium univalentiumque numeris valde irregularibus) differt. This morphologically intermediate plant often shows hybrid vigor; it was first studied by A. Sleep (a.o., in Lin & Sleep, loc. cit.) who collected it in Japan (Kyushu: Ashi-Kita-cho, 1 Nov 1968, A. Sleep & M. Kido AS/605; BM, PE, TI, Z).
200004153 | Z. R. Wang and K. Q. Wang (Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 8. 2003) reported a hybrid between Asplenium pekinense and A. exiguum (as A. yunnanense), "A. ×jingyunense," and one between A. pekinense and A. varians, "A. ×longmenense," but the two names were not validly published because no Latin description or diagnosis, or reference to such, was provided (Melbourne Code, Art. 39.1).

200004157 | Asplenium prolongatum was confused with A. rutifolium (Bergius) Kunze by Franchet and Savatier (Enum. Pl. Jap. 222. 1876), Makino (Phan. Pter. Jap.

200004157 | Though Japanese plants of Asplenium prolongatum were reported to be tetraploid with 2n = 144 (Iwatsuki, Fl. Jap. 1: 103. 1995), all Chinese plants (Guangdong, Guizhou, Hainan) checked by flow cytometry are hexaploid and may have to be ascribed to a new taxon. Asplenium ×kenzoi Kurata, the hybrid with A. wrightii, may also occur in China where its parents often grow together.

200004158 | Asplenium pseudolaserpitiifolium was often misidentified as A. laserpitiifolium auct. non Lamarck, e.g., by Kunze (Bot. Zeitung (Berlin) 6: 521-526. 1848), Hayata (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 23: 24-34. 1909), Bonaparte (Notes Ptérid. 7: 135-139. 1918), Nakai (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 39: 120. 1925), Tardieu (Asplén. Tonkin, 48. 1932), Ogata (Icon. Fil. Jap. 6: t. 256. 1935), H. Itô (Index Spec. Typic. Herb. Japon. 4. 1959; J. Jap. Bot. 49: 97-104. 1974), Iwatsuki (Ferns Japan, 147. 1992), Iwatsuki et al. (Fl. Japan. 1: 105. 1995); or as A. cuneatum auct. non Lamarck by De Vol and Kuo (Fl. Taiwan 1: 482. 1975).
200004158 | Asplenium pseudolaserpitiifolium belongs to a group of large 3- or 4-pinnate species similar to A. laserpitiifolium Lamarck and revised by Tardieu and Ching (Notul. Syst. (Paris) 5: 134-154. 1936), who described five new Indochinese species. Study of the types shows that characters used to describe or key out their taxa are variable and not diagnostic. Our field studies show that habitat conditions and plant age may strongly influence frond morphology and lamina texture. Frond segments of plants collected after desiccation stress are ± curled inward and have a more narrowly cuneate form instead of their original rhombic shape. In the same paper, A. pseudolaserpitiifolium was described and keyed out as a terrestrial plant, but data on the labels of several paratypes state plants were epiphytic. Flow cytometric analyses show plants are octoploids in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan; no data are available from the literature. Spores of the type specimens of A. neolaserpitiifolium and A. pseudolaserpitiifolium are identical.

242305990 | Asplenium qiujiangense is similar to A. magnificum but has more falcate and more acute segments, with a gemma at the acroscopic margin at the pinna base. It can also be confused with A. paucivenosum, which has a larger mean exospore length (48 µm in A. paucivenosum vs. 43 µm in A. qiujiangense). In critical cases, a chromosome count will be necessary.

Reihe 14(1/2): 77. 1965) belongs here but was not validly published because no type was indicated (Melbourne Code, Art. 40.1); its "type" was a cultivated plant and not a specimen as required by Art. 8.4. If the proposal to conserve the name A. trichomanes with a conserved type, based on a diploid plant according to its traditional ("2x") use and in compliance with Art. 57.1, is not accepted then the name for the current tetraploid species will have to change to A. trichomanes.

250098326 | Based on its peculiar morphology and venation pattern, Asplenium ruprechtii has often been put in the satellite genus Camptosorus Link, containing two species (one in Asia, the other in North America). Modern studies have shown that Camptosorus nests within Asplenium and does not form a separate clade.

200004165 | Asplenium ruta-muraria is an autotetraploid species, very common and widespread in Europe, where it often grows on buildings and walls. It has originated by chromosome doubling in its diploid ancestor A. dolomiticum (see above), from which is genetically isolated, and which has smaller spores and half the number of chromosomes. Their triploid sterile hybrid, A. ×baldense Sleep et al., is usually found where both species grow together. There is considerable variation in frond shape, and size and degree of dissection, best known and mainly described from Europe (e.g., von Heufler, Verh. Zool.-Bot. Vereins Wien 6: 235-354. 1856; Luerssen in Rabenhorst, Krypt.-Fl., 218-228. 1889; Christ, Farnkr. Schweiz, 75-79. 1900; Hedwigia 42: 153-177. 1903; Rosenstock, Allg. Bot. Z.

250098345 | Asplenium sampsonii is similar to A. thunbergii Kunze (=A. belangeri (Bory) Kunze (1848), not Bory (1833)) from Malaysia and Indonesia, but it is smaller, not gemmiferous on the rachis; the lower pinnae are reduced; and the perispore is different. The distinction between A. sampsonii and A. thunbergii in Chinese floras (e.g., S. H. Wu, FRPS 4(2): 124. 1999; T. L. Wu et al., Fl. Guangdong 7: 190, 203-204. 2006) is based largely on size differences. Manton (in Holttum, Revis. Fl. Malaya 2: 623-627. 1954) found that plants from Malaysia are tetraploid, but since specimens from Hainan and Guangxi are decaploid, we are confident that they are different from true A. thunbergii, which probably does not occur in China. Plants of A. tenerum with bipinnatifid fronds can be similar to this species.

200004167 | "Asplenium saulii" (Hooker & Baker, Syn. Fil., ed. 2, 216. 1874) is evidently a mere orthographic variant of A. sarelii.
200004167 | Asplenium sarelii is endemic to C China. All reports of this species from outside China are erroneous and usually refer to the very similar tetraploid A. anogrammoides. Hybridization experiments, including cytological study of meiotic behavior in artificially produced hybrids (Lin & Sleep in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 111-127. 1989), and micromorphological study of type material have shown that A. sarelii is one of the parental species of allotetraploid A. anogrammoides; the other parent being diploid A. tenuicaule. These findings were confirmed by cytological and isozyme studies (Wang, Acta Bot. Sin. 45: 1-14. 2003). The morphological similarity between these taxa has led to great confusion, also with true A. pekinense, which is the autotetraploid that originated from true A. sarelii. In A. sarelii, the ultimate segments are less than 1.2 mm wide, the pinnae stalks less than 1 mm wide, and its pinnae are distant from each other and hardly overlap so that the frond silhouette is more open than in A. anogrammoides. Important differential characters are the chromosome number and the average exospore and stomata size. Identification based on morphology alone is very difficult when A. sarelii grows with A. pekinense and A. anogrammoides. At such locations, e.g., Wudang Shan (Hubei) and Huping Shan (Hunan), the sterile triploid hybrids, A. ×wudangshanense (A. pekinense × A. sarelii) and A. ×huawuense (A. anogrammoides × A. sarelii), are relatively common and recognizable by their aborted spores and often undeveloped sporangia. Asplenium ×wudangshanense Viane, Reichstein, Rasbach & Y. X. Lin, nothosp. nov. Type: China. Hubei: Wudang Shan, ca. 2050 m, Sep 1907, Silvestri 6 (pl. 5) (holotype, FI).

Meiotic chromosome behavior in A. ×wudangshanense confirms that A. pekinense is the autotetraploid of A. sarelii. Meiotic chromosome behavior (Wang in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 133-134. 1989; loc. cit. 2003) in A. ×huawuense confirms that A. anogrammoides is allotetraploid and contains one chromosome set of A. sarelii. Asplenium ×huawuense Z. R.

Plants from the Malay Peninsula were found to be tetraploid (n = ca. 72) by Manton (in Holttum, Revis. Fl.

250098341 | The range of Asplenium semivarians is not well known due to confusion with similar species of the A. varians complex. It may also occur in Malaysia (Johore), but the single specimen, cited by Morton under A. varians, needs further study. Experimental hybridization and micromorphology have shown (Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003) that it is different from diploid A. tenuicaule and that it is an ancestor of true A. varians. Asplenium semivarians is known from S India as diploid A. varians (e.g., Manickam & Irudayaraj, Cytol. Ferns W. Ghats, 38, 71. 1988; Pterid. Fl. Nilgiris, 130-131. 2003) or as diploid A. laciniatum (Bir & Irudayaraj, Fern Gaz. 16: 186-187. 2001). Luxurious plants become almost tripinnate. This species can be distinguished from similar taxa by its diploid chromosome number, its alate perispore with the middle perispore lacking in the areoles (zones between the ridges), and the smaller exospore and guard cells.

200004176 | Asplenium tenuicaule is an ancestral diploid species involved in a reticulate pattern of relationships unraveled in the 1980s-1990s (Sleep & Reichstein, Candollea 39: 675-691. 1984; Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003) by micromorphological studies and cytological research in China (Y. X. Lin, Z. R. Wang), England (A. Sleep), Germany (H. Rasbach), and Switzerland (T. Reichstein, R. Viane). This reticulate evolution, with its inherent general morphological fuzziness, has led to much misunderstanding and confusion. Asplenium tenuicaule is parental to the following taxa with which it can easily be confused: A. kansuense, A. varians, A. altajense, A. anogrammoides, A. mae, and A. kukkonenii. The name A. varians auct. non Wallich ex Hooker was often used for, or included in, this taxon (e.g., Franchet & Savatier, Enum. Pl. Jap. 220-221. 1877; Beddome, Handb. Ferns Brit.

Pakistan 1: 270. 1992; Cryptog. Fl. Pakistan 2: 332. 1993). During sporogenesis, plants of this species may produce relatively high numbers of diplospores (a spore containing a double set of chromosomes), which may have played a role in the production of polyploid offspring, e.g., Asplenium kansuense, A. mae (see below).
200004176 | In places where Asplenium tenuicaule and A. varians grow together, their sterile hybrid is not uncommon.
200004176 | This is a widespread and variable species ranging from the E African highlands (rare) via the Himalaya to S (Altai) and SE Siberia, Korea, China, Japan, and Hawaii. It can be divided into three varieties, with overlapping ranges in China and Japan. Few but fertile intermediates have been found. Hybridization experiments have shown that the varieties are genetically very similar (Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003). Kuo (Taiwania 30: 5-100. 1985) was probably the first to apply the name correctly.

200004177 | "Asplenium concinnum" (Wallich, Numer. List, no. 216. 1829) belongs here but is a nomen nudum and was not therefore validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)).
200004177 | Asplenium tenuifolium is common in the Himalaya. It is probably an aggregate of diploid plants with 2n = 72 chromosomes (reported from India; Bir, Curr. Sci. 29: 445-447. 1960; Caryologia 18: 107-115. 1965) and tetraploids (specimens from Guangxi and Guangdong). More studies are needed. Most plants have small dormant buds (one or more) on the adaxial side of the costa (near the first acroscopic costule or more distal) or on the costules. It is often fertile when still young (var. minor S. H. Wu) and can then be confused with A. capillipes (gemmae in axil between costa and rachis) or with A. tenuicaule (without gemmae). The presence and position of its gemmae are diagnostic. We agree with Tagawa (Acta Phytotax. Geobot. 8: 91-100. 1939) that there are no significant differences between A. tenuissimum and A. tenuifolium.

Fronds approximate, subcaespitose; stipe dull grayish brown to stramineous, 15-25(-35) cm, with scales similar to those on rhizome; lamina narrowly triangular-ovate, 35-40(-45) × (10-)13-22 cm, 1-pinnate, apex triangular and pinnatifid, acute to acuminate; pinnae 12-20 pairs, subopposite, shortly stalked (2-3 mm), basal pinnae only slightly reduced, largest pinnae (8-)10-14 × 1.5-3 cm, narrowly trapeziform-trullate and slightly falcate, base asymmetrical, acroscopic side truncate and often auriculate, basiscopic side narrowly cuneate, margin irregularly crenate-sinuate to crenate-serrate, apex acute-acuminate. Costa slightly sinuous, raised abaxially, adaxially with 2 ridges and sulcate; veins slender, 2- or 3-forked. Fronds firmly herbaceous, glaucous to yellowish brown-green or grayish green when dry, abaxially with minute, brown, hairlike scales; rachis grayish green to stramineous, with sparse scales, narrowly winged below apex, often gemmiferous below terminal segment. Sori linear, (0.8-)1-2 cm, usually on acroscopic vein, at an angle of 10°-25° with costa; indusia grayish brown, linear, membranous, margin with thin hyaline cells, entire, usually opening toward costa, rolling back and erose but persistent.

242306063 | In soil or on rocks in forests; 600-1600 m. Guangxi, Hunan, Xizang, Yunnan [Myanmar, Vietnam].
242306063 | Asplenium trapezoideum is a rare species, superficially similar to the more common A. wrightii, but it has a different rachis and costa structure and is often proliferous near the apex. Flow cytometry of plants from Myanmar show these are probably octoploid. Asplenium trapezoideum is closely similar and shares its perispore pattern with the NE Indian A. khasianum Sledge, which may even be conspecific.
242306063 | Asplenium subtrapezoideum, distinguished on size differences, is put into synonymy because fertile intermediate plants exist.

Plants 10-30 cm tall. Rhizome erect, short, scaly; scales narrowly triangular, 3(-4) × ca. 0.5 mm, with opaque, red to dark brown central stripe and paler narrow clathrate borders, entire. Fronds caespitose; stipe shiny castaneous-brown, 2-8 cm, base scaly, upward subglabrous, abaxially semiterete but adaxially grooved, with brown, membranous and subentire narrow wings, texture papery, stipe and rachis usually persisting after shedding of pinnae; lamina linear, 10-25 × 0.9-1.6 cm, base slightly reduced, 1-pinnate, apex acute and 2-4 mm wide; pinnae 20-30 pairs, usually obliquely inserted, sessile, middle pinnae elliptic or ovate to orbicular, 2.5-7.5 × 2-4 mm, base nearly symmetrical, cuneate, margin crenate, apex obtuse; lower pinnae gradually reduced. Veins pinnate, costa obscure, veins obliquely simple or up to 2-forked, basal acroscopic vein usually 2-forked. Fronds papery, green or brown when dry, average stomatal guard cell length 35-42 µm; rachis castaneous, shiny, subglabrous, abaxially terete, adaxially grooved and with a relatively low lateral brown membranous wing.

Asplenium trichomanes is often circumscribed as a collective species consisting of various cytotypes (six taxa are known from C and S Europe). These taxa, for convenience often recognized at the subspecific level, are reproductively isolated (producing sterile hybrids when growing together) and are treated as species in this flora. The species can be distinguished by microcharacters, by flow cytometry, by counting chromosomes, and by their edaphic preference. When the complex is subdivided into species or subspecies, the diploid silicolous taxon has been designated (since Lovis, Brit. Fern Gaz. 9: 147-160. 1964) as A. trichomanes s.s. or as subsp. trichomanes; the common tetraploid as A. quadrivalens or as A. trichomanes subsp. quadrivalens D. E. Meyer. A lectotype was selected in this sense by Viane (in Jonsell & Jarvis, Nordic J. Bot. 14: 145-164. 1994), but as a result of the Linnean typification project this selection was overruled by Grubovs (Novosti Sist. Vyssh. Rast. 21: 5-21. 1984), who "selected" the tetraploid specimen in the Linnaean Herbarium at LINN as type without any argument or fundamental study. However, pending a proposal to conserve the name A. trichomanes with a conserved type, based on a diploid plant, we continue to use the name A. trichomanes s.s. in its traditional ("2x") sense in compliance with Art. 57.1 of the Melbourne Code. However, if such a proposal is not accepted, the correct specific name for the current diploid species will not only have to change to A. melanocaulon Willdenow, but the name A. trichomanes will have to be given to the following tetraploid taxon, A. quadrivalens.Asplenium ×lusaticum D. E. Meyer (the sterile hybrid between A. trichomanes and A. quadrivalens) is not rare where both parents grow together. It can be easily recognized by its aborted spores. In China, this hybrid is cytologically confirmed for Sichuan ("Longchi").

Further studies will need to characterize and distinguish them, not only from each other but also from the non-gemmiferous, Macaronesian A. anceps.
242306066 | This species is similar in outline to Asplenium trichomanes, but the plants can easily be distinguished by their triangular and winged stipe and rachis and by the presence of a bud on some fronds.

200004182 | Sleep and Reichstein (Candollea 39: 675-691. 1984), following Morton (Contr. U.S. Natl. Herb. 38: 215-281. 1973), discussed the problem of the application of the name Asplenium laciniatum D. Don (Prodr. Fl. Nepal. 8. 1825). That name applies to a taxon closely related to A. varians, but its type is merely a depauperate single frond with a few spores and is not adequate for the precise application of the name. Moore (Index Fil. 139. 1857) and Hooker (Sp. Fil. 3: 164-165. 1860) misapplied the name A. laciniatum to another Himalayan fern species not related to A. varians, i.e., A. gueinzianum. Most later authors then followed that misapplied concept of A. laciniatum. Viane and Reichstein (Taxon 35: 605-606. 1986) formally proposed A. laciniatum for rejection, but their proposal was rejected by the Nomenclature Committee for Pteridophyta (Pichi Sermolli, Taxon 36: 740-741. 1987).
200004182 | Asplenium varians is variable, very similar to, and often confused with its ancestors, A. semivarians and A. tenuicaule (see above). Its relationships were discovered using hybridization experiments, chromosome counts, and micromorphology (Sleep & Reichstein, loc. cit.; Viane & Reichstein, Pterid. New Millennium, 73-105. 2003), showing it is an allotetraploid species that arose by chromosome doubling in the diploid hybrid between A. tenuicaule (A. tenuicaule var. subvarians in A. varians var. varians, and A. tenuicaule var. tenuicaule in the African A. varians var. fimbriatum) and A. semivarians. Two varieties are distinguished: A. varians var. varians, occurring in the Himalaya from N India into China (not in Japan), and var. fimbriatum, which is mainly found in S Africa (though its occurrence in S India needs further study). Asplenium paucijugum Ching is similar to A. semivarians but has larger spores and stomata. Further study is needed to show if this and related forms are autotetraploids of A. semivarians.
200004182 | In places where Asplenium tenuicaule and A. varians grow together, their sterile hybrid is not uncommon.
200004182 | In an outdated understanding of this complex, Fraser-Jenkins et al. (Indian Fern J. 27(1-2): 188. 2011) confusingly combined ancestral diploid and derived allotetraploid species and hybrids under a single amalgamate called Asplenium laciniatum, apparently ignoring hybridization experiments and cytological studies.

200004187 | Most of the taxa put into synonymy of Asplenium wrightii were based on variable characters, often of relatively small plants (nicely fitting a herbarium sheet). Within this aggregate, the name A. wrightii is generally applicable to the larger plants, but existing herbarium material is inadequate as it does not cover the morphological variation and cytology is usually unknown. A set of morphological and size characters separates this complex into four major, but probably artificial, groups. A first, including A. wrightii, has pinnae more than 10 cm, sori more than 8 mm, and veins in the middle of the pinna 2-forked. A second group, including A. pseudowrightii, also has pinnae of more than 10 cm, but shorter sori (less than 8 mm), and veins only 1-forked in the middle of pinnae. Two groups with the largest pinnae less than 10 cm include A. wrightioides (with sori 6-11 mm) and A. centrochinense with sori less than 6 mm.
200004187 | Japanese plants (Kurita, Rep. (Annual) Foreign Students Coll. Chiba Univ. 41-56. 1967; Mitui, Bull. Nippon Dental Coll., Gen. Educ. 4: 221-271. 1975) are octoploids (2n = 288), but Z. R. Wang (in K. H. Shing & K. U. Kramer, Proc. Int. Symp. Syst. Pterid. 133-134. 1989) reported tetraploids (2n = 144) from Yunnan. Our recent flow-cytometry showed additional ploidy levels (10x and 12x), but because no correlation was found between ploidy levels and gross morphological characters, we refrain from recognizing separate species pending further micromorphological, cytological, and molecular research.
200004187 | Asplenium pseudowrightii was erroneously ascribed to Hainan. This was due to a wrong stamp on the holotype sheet in PE, which is without a collection label. However, all isotypes have the same collectors label (numbered "37818"), and collection labels state the plants origin: "Guangdong: Xin Yi, Har Sick Joun, stream side, 15 Nov. 1934." Some plants from near the type locality are tetraploid (the lowest ploidy level in this complex), while others are 12x (highest ploidy level in this aggregate).
200004187 | The type of Asplenium duplicatoserratum ("S. S. Sin 469A") is also a syntype of A. centrochinense f. maximum. Asplenium duplicatoserratum is a large plant with serrate to biserrate pinnae similar to those of A. wrightii but with much shorter sori.
200004187 | Asplenium ×wangii C. M. Kuo (Bot. Bull. Acad. Sin. 29: 109-111. 1988) is a hybrid between A. wrightii s.l. and A. bullatum; it was described from Taiwan and may be present where these taxa co-occur (Fujian, Guizhou, Hunan, Sichuan, Taiwan, and Yunnan). Asplenium ×shikokianum Makino (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 13: 13. 1899, pro sp., described from Japan), the natural hexaploid hybrid between octoploid A. wrightii and tetraploid A. ritoense, is not uncommon where its parents grow together (e.g., Guizhou, Taiwan). Asplenium ×kenzoi Kurata (J. Geobot. 11: 68. 1962) is from the cross with A. prolongatum.

Veins obvious, grooved adaxially, basal acroscopic vein multi-forked, other veins 1- or 2-forked. Fronds subleathery, grass-green to stramineous when dry, adaxially with wrinkles above veins, small, brown, narrowly triangular and apically filiform scales on abaxial surface and pinna stalks, subglabrous when old; rachis (when dry) abaxially grayish castaneous to green-stramineous for most of its length, and with small narrowly triangular and apically filiform scales, adaxially longitudinally valleculate, gemmae or juvenile plants near rachis on pinna stalks. Sori linear, 4-8 mm, from near costa running nearly to margin, distal sori close to rachis; indusia grayish brown, linear, entire, opening toward costa or first acroscopic vein.

200004191 | Asplenium yoshinagae is a sexual octoploid plant in S India (Kuriachan in Fabbri, Caryologia 18: 675-731. 1965), Japan (Shimura & Takiguchi, J. Jap. Bot. 54: 311-318. 1979), and China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Xizang, and Yunnan). It is morphologically very variable and similar to A. indicum (see above). In China, A. yoshinagae is usually a larger and more vigorous plant with larger spores and stomata than A. indicum. They can easily be distinguished by a chromosome count or by flow-cytometry. The presence of gemmae is a highly unreliable character, at least in China, where most octoploids checked were not gemmiferous. Due to confusion among these taxa, the exact distribution of this species is not well documented.
200004191 | Asplenium tibeticum, only known from the type collection from Xizang, has leathery fronds morphologically almost intermediate between A. yoshinagae and A. gueinzianum; however, its long slender stipe scales and epidermal and soral cell patterns agree with those of A. yoshinagae, and its average exospore length of 40 µm also fits for this taxon.

250098354 | ● Forests, often on slopes in moist to wet conditions; 1000-2200 m. Taiwan.
250098354 | Our description of Hymenasplenium adiantifrons differs from Chings, which was solely based on the type and the drawing of Hayata. Although Ching (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 10: 187-188. 1965) compared this taxon essentially to H. latidens, it is morphologically also similar to H. changputungense and H. szechuanense. In the literature (Kurata, J. Geobot. 11: 67-68. 1962; Sugimoto, Keys Herb. Pl. Jap. Pterid. 356, 406. 1966; Nakaike, Enum. Pterid. Jap. 97. 1975), this species has sometimes been synonymized or confused (Taiwan) with H. filipes (Copeland) Sugimoto (Philippines) from which it differs, i.a., by its retuse marginal teeth (entire in H. filipes), its shiny stipe and rachis (almost dull in H. filipes), and spreading pinnae (pointing upward in H. filipes).

250098359 | As circumscribed, Hymenasplenium apogamum is an aggregate species, which, according to Cheng and Murakami (J. Plant Res. 111: 496. 1998), is both morphologically and cytologically variable. In China (Yunnan), it consists of sexual diploids (n = 39), sexual tetraploids (n = 78), and the more widespread agamosporous triploids ("n" = 2n = 117). In their 1998 publication (loc. cit.), Cheng and Murakami also recognized another triploid agamosporous taxon ("H. laterepens," nom. nud) related to H. apogamum but differing in its more triangular leaves. As the distribution and relationships of the Asian "unilaterale" group are not well understood, the present treatment only reflects the current state of limited knowledge.

250098347 | On rocks or sandy soils in forests near streams. Hainan [Vietnam (Cao Bang)].
250098347 | Hymenasplenium cardiophyllum is often classified under Boniniella Hayata (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 41: 709. 1927), an endemic genus of E Asia here included in Hymenasplenium. Recent flow cytometric and cytological studies show that this taxon includes two cytologically different species: tetraploid Hymenasplenium ikenoi (Makino) Viane, comb. nov. (Basionym: Scolopendrium ikenoi Makino, Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 13: 130. 1899; Boniniella ikenoi (Makino) Hayata; Phyllitis ikenoi (Makino) C. Christensen), from Japan (Ryukyu Islands and Bonin Islands), and diploid H. cardiophyllum from China. Apart from their different chromosome number these taxa can also be separated by their average exospore length (21-24 µm for diploid H. cardiophyllum vs. 28-32 µm for tetraploid H. ikenoi. However, further studies need to unravel their exact relationships. Plants from Vietnam and Thailand (Boonkerd & Pollawatn, Sci. Asia 38: 125-128. 2012) require further study as to their ploidy level and true identity, as spore size of the Thai plants suggest a hexaploid situation.
250098347 | A study of its dorsiventral dictyostele, raphides, chromosome number, and perispore led Kato et al. (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 103: 461-468. 1990) to include H. ikenoi in Hymenasplenium. The chromosome number of 2n = 156 (Kato et al., loc. cit.: 463) indicates that H. ikenoi is a tetraploid with a basic chromosome number of x = 39; this recent count is in agreement with the n = 78 bivalents that can be counted on the photograph published by Kurita (Rep. (Annual) Foreign Students Coll. Chiba Univ. 7: 48. 1972). A base chromosome number of x = 38 or 39 coincides with that of Hymenasplenium.
250098347 | Kato et al. (loc. cit.: 467) suggested a closer affinity of Hymenasplenium ikenoi to H. excisum, H. apogamum, and H. obscurum than to H. cheilosorum and the group of H. cataractarum, H. hondoense, and H. obliquissimum. However, recent molecular studies seem to show that H. ikenoi is more closely related to the H. hondoense, H. apogamum, and H. cataractarum clade, and that it originated recently from the ancestor of the above three species (Murakami, J. Plant Res. 108: 257-268. 1995).

Veins distinct, forking and free, 1 vein per marginal lobe and ending below sharp tooth, basiscopic side with 6 or 7 veins lacking. Sori linear, 1-3 mm, at tip of subtending veins and located in marginal teeth; indusia persistent, yellowish brown to deep brown, semi-elliptic, membranous, entire.

242325814 | As presently circumscribed, Hymenasplenium cheilosorum is an aggregate of a widespread triploid agamosporous taxon and probably more local (Yunnan) sexual (diploid) and tetraploid (Guizhou) taxa. This distinctive complex was examined cytologically by Mehra and Bir (Cytologia 25: 17-27. 1960) using Himalayan material and later again by Mitui et al. (Amer. J. Bot. 76: 1689-1697. 1989) using Japanese plants. Mehra and Bir (loc. cit.) listed E Himalayan H. cheilosorum as a triploid agamosporous plant but with the incorrect chromosome number of "n" = 108 (based on x = 36). Mitui et al. (loc. cit.: 1690-1691) showed that both Himalayan and Japanese H. cheilosorum are apomictic and triploid, but with "n" = 2n = 117 (based on x = 39) chromosomes. Cheng and Murakami (J. Plant Res. 111: 495-500. 1998) found an ancestral sexual diploid taxon in Yunnan, with spore mother cells showing 39 bivalents at metaphase I, but without describing it formally as a separate species. We found a single tetraploid population in Guizhou (Yaoren Shan). Species of this alliance can be distinguished from the closely related, also sexually reproducing, H. inthanonense N. Murakami & J. Yokoyama from N Thailand, by their more terminal sori and more dimidiate pinnae.

250098360 | Hymenasplenium excisum represents a distinct species complex with sexual diploids (2n = 78) and tetraploids (2n = 156) in China (Yunnan) and Indonesia (Mitui et al., Amer. J. Bot. 76: 1691. 1989; Cheng and Murakami, J. Plant Res. 111: 496. 1998). Cheng and Murakami (loc. cit.) mentioned a new endemic species complex, "H. costarisorum," from two localities in S Yunnan, said to be similar to H. excisum in gross morphology but different in smaller size, larger number of pinnae, more strongly reflexed lower pinnae, and sori restricted to the distal part of the pinnae. This undescribed taxon containing two cytotypes, a sexual diploid (n = 36) and a sexual tetraploid (n = 72), has a basic chromosome number of x = 36, which is universal in Aspleniaceae, except Hymenasplenium (with x = 38 and x = 39). Molecular data (Murakami, J. Plant Res. 108: 257-268. 1995) showed that this "species" is closely related to H. obscurum (with a chromosome number of x = 39).

250098358 | Asplenium hondoense N. Murakami & Hatanaka, J. Fac. Sci. Univ. Tokyo, Sect. 3, Bot. 14: 191. 1988.
250098358 | Plants 25-40 cm tall. Rhizomes shortly creeping, 2-3 mm in diam., apex densely scaly; scales castaneous to dark brown, narrowly triangular; phyllopodia distinct, ca. 2 mm tall, ca. 10 mm apart. Fronds grayish green when dry, herbaceous; lamina 1-pinnate, narrowly triangular to lanceolate, 10-20 × 3-5 cm, widest in basal 1/3, gradually narrowing toward apex, glabrous; stipe shiny, purple, 10-25 × 0.05-0.15 cm, subglabrous, base sparsely scaly; rachis shiny, purplish abaxially, adaxial side grooved and with 2 grayish green narrow wings; pinnae almost sessile to shortly stalked with rachis color extending via stipicel onto base of costa abaxially, 15-25 pairs, alternate, usually ascending, trapeziform to falcate, 2-3.5 × 0.6-1 cm, base asymmetrical, acroscopic side truncate, basiscopic side attenuate-cuneate with 1/3-1/2 cut away, acroscopic margin serrate, teeth not retuse, pinna apex subacute to obtuse.

Plants usually agamosporous.
250098358 | Usually on wet rocks near streams in forests. Fujian, Guangxi, Sichuan [NE India, Japan, Korea, Nepal].
250098358 | The distribution of Hymenasplenium hondoense is not well known due to confusion with other members of the genus. As presently circumscribed, this is a cytologically variable, aggregate species. Usually plants are agamosporous diploids ("n" = 2n = 72) or triploids ("n" = 2n = 117), but in China, sexual diploids and tetraploids exist. The elucidation of this aggregate and its relationships to the other SE Asian members of the "unilaterale" group will require more study.

250098357 | Usually on wet rocks near or in streams in forests. Jiangxi, Taiwan, Yunnan [Japan].
250098357 | Due to the previous confusion in the Hymenasplenium unilaterale s.l. group, the distribution of H. murakami-hatanakae is not well known. As an ancestral diploid, it may have played an important role in the reticulate evolution of Hymenasplenium in Asia and along the Pacific. However, the elucidation of relationships in the "unilaterale" group will require much more micromorphological and molecular studies. True H. unilaterale may be largely absent from India, the Himalaya, and the Pacific region, where its nomenclature urgently needs to be brought in line with data published by Cheng and Murakami (J. Plant Res. 111: 495-500. 1998).
250098357 | Asplenium pubirhizoma Ching & Z. Y. Liu, described from Sichuan, may represent a species of its own although it was considered a synonym of A. unilaterale s.l. by Wu (FRPS 4(2): 38. 1999); it is similar to Hymenasplenium murakami-hatanakae but differs in its gray, hairy scales and its more medial sori.

250098361 | Plants 20-30 cm tall. Rhizomes shortly creeping, 1.5-2.5 mm in diam., apex densely scaly; scales grayish brown, broadly ovate-triangular; phyllopodia distinct, ca. 2 mm tall, up to 10 mm apart. Fronds very thin to translucent, brown-green when dry; lamina 1-pinnate, narrowly triangular to lanceolate, 15-24 × 2.5-5 cm, widest in basal 1/3, apex gradually narrowing, subglabrous; stipe shiny, dark castaneous-purple, 10-20 cm, subglabrous, base sparsely scaly; rachis shiny, dark castaneous-purple abaxially, adaxial side grooved and with 2 grayish green narrow wings; pinnae strongly dimidiate, shortly stalked and purplish rachis color extending via stipicel onto costa abaxially, 15-25 pairs, alternate, ascending, trapeziform to falcate, 1.5-3.5 × 0.4-0.7 cm, base asymmetrical, acroscopic side truncate, basiscopic side straight with more than 1/2 cut away, acroscopic margin (bi)crenate-sinuate, teeth obtuse and not retuse, apex subacute to obtuse. Veins forking and terminating in marginal teeth, (2 or)3 or 4 basal basiscopic veins lacking. Sori linear, 3-4 mm, basal on subtending vein and appearing subcostal; indusia brownish, linear, membranous, entire, opening toward costa. Plants sexual or agamosporous.

250098361 | Hymenasplenium obliquissimum is an aggregate of species with different chromosome number and life strategy; three cytotypes, based on x = 39, are known. A diploid sexual (2n = 78), a tetraploid sexual (2n = 156), and a triploid agamosporous type (2n = 117) which is probably a hybrid between the diploid and the tetraploid (Murakami, Pl. Spec. Biol. 13: 51-56. 1998). A thin lamina (only 2 epidermal layers) is characteristic for this taxon but occurs elsewhere in the genus and is influenced by growing conditions; using it as a diagnostic character may lead to wrong identifications.
250098361 | In the literature (Iwatsuki, Ferns Japan, 151. 1992; Hasebe et al., Amer. Fern J. 85: 134-181. 1995; Iwatsuki et al., Fl. Japan 1: 109 1995), this species has sometimes been put into synonymy with Hymenasplenium filipes (Philippines), but considering cytological and morphological differences, we prefer to keep these taxa distinct. Hymenasplenium obliquissimum differs from H. filipes by its thinner lamina, thicker rhizome (up to 0.15 cm in H. filipes), shinier stipe and rachis (almost dull in H. filipes), rachis color extending onto the costa, larger number of pinnae (up to 15 in H. filipes), larger number of reduced basal basiscopic veins (1 or 2 in H. filipes), and sorus position along the subtending vein (median in H. filipes).
250098361 | Asplenium unilaterale Lamarck var. decurrens (Beddome) H. S. Kung (Fl. Sichuan. 6: 357. 1988; A. resectum Smith var. decurrens Beddome, Suppl. Ferns S. Ind. 10. 1876) was treated as a synonym of A. unilaterale var. udum in FRPS (4(2): 38-40. 1999).

242325815 | Plants 20-40 cm tall. Rhizome long creeping, 3-4.5 mm in diam., apex scaly; scales dark brown, narrowly triangular to triangular. Fronds remote, up to 10 mm apart, grayish green when dry, papery to herbaceous, subglabrous; stipe dull green to grayish green when dry, not shiny or purple, 20(-25) cm, sparsely scaly to subglabrous; lamina 1-pinnate, narrowly ovate-triangular, 20-30 × 5-10 cm, base truncate, apex acuminate to caudate; rachis grayish green, subglabrous; pinnae 20-30 pairs, sessile to obscurely stalked, trapeziform-falcate, middle pinnae 3.5-7 × 0.8-1.3 cm, dimidiate, apex obtuse to subacute, base asymmetrical, acroscopic side truncate and parallel to rachis, basiscopic side of basal pinnae excavate, in middle pinnae narrowly cuneate and entire, acroscopic margin serrate to crenate, teeth not retuse, pinnae spreading to ascending.

242325815 | Mitui et al. (Amer. J. Bot. 76: 1690-1691. 1989) reported that this species is a sexual tetraploid with 2n = 156 in Java (Indonesia). Cheng and Murakami (J. Plant Res. 111: 496. 1998) and Kato et al. (Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 105: 105-124. 1992) reported related sexual diploid and tetraploid taxa from Yunnan (see under Hymenasplenium pseudobscurum), and we found hexaploids in Hainan; consequently, the taxon as here circumscribed is a complex with different cytotypes involved. Contrary to literature citations, Asplenium serriforme Mettenius is not listed here as a synonym because the drawing and the description by Mettenius (Abh. Senckenberg. Naturf. Ges. 3: 163. 1859) clearly state that it has retuse ("serraturae obtusae emarginato") teeth, and thus it represents another taxon probably more related to the H. adiantifrons group.
242325815 | In Taiwan most specimens formerly identified as Hymenasplenium obscurum have an inner and outer indusium and are H. pseudobscurum (Ralf Knapp, pers. comm.); the detailed occurrence of true H. obscurum in China needs more study, and its presence in Taiwan requires confirmation.

250098362 | Murakami (J. Plant Res. 108: 261. 1995) used, but did not validly publish, the name "bilabiatum" for this taxon; he reported it from N Thailand to N Vietnam and from Taiwan. Hymenasplenium pseudobscurum is an aggregate of a diploid and a tetraploid taxon (Kato et al., Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 105: 105-124. 1992; Cheng & Murakami, J. Plant Res. 111: 498. 1998), and further research is needed to discriminate between them. Molecular studies of Murakami (loc. cit.: 266) demonstrated that H. pseudobscurum is closely related to H. obscurum.
250098362 | The special allantodioid sorus, with an inner and an outer indusium, is also found in Hymenasplenium bivalvatum (B. K. Nayar & Geevarghese) Viane, comb. et stat. nov.

The occurrence of H. bivalvatum in S China needs to be verified; however, according to Ralf Knapp (pers. comm.), most Taiwanese specimens formerly identified as H. obscurum are H. pseudobscurum.

250098351 | ● On rocks by streams. Sichuan, Yunnan.
250098351 | Hymenasplenium szechuanense is similar to H. furfuraceum from which it differs in its much less floccose to subglabrous rachis and stipe, its inframedial sori, and its more reddish purple rachis. It differs from H. quercicola in its inframedial sori and more dark purple stipe. Hymenasplenium latidens is also similar but differs by the characters given in the key and by its slightly more numerous pinna pairs; future research will have to show their relationship. All these taxa also resemble H. obliquissimum but that species has its veins ending in marginal teeth, not below a notch in a marginal tooth as in this group. Due to confusion with similar taxa, the relationships and the distribution of this species are not well known.

250098348 | ● On shaded wet rocks by streams; 1900-2700 m. W Yunnan.
250098348 | Hymenasplenium wuliangshanense is most similar to the following taxa: H. furfuraceum to H. changputungense. The upper margin of its pinnae is finely and regularly denticulate, with relatively deep notches (often as deep as the teeth) so that there is no obvious difference between a notch and a "normal" sinus. Hymenasplenium latidens has slightly coarser teeth and more medial sori. It is also similar to H. adiantifrons, which has a more coarsely cut margin and a more castaneous-purple rachis. Future research will have to establish the true relationships in this group. This and the following seven species form a group of related taxa that can best be distinguished by their veins that terminate below a notch in each marginal tooth. A similar taxon, Asplenium ofeliae Soldago, is known from the Philippines.

200003757 | Athyrium brevifrons is very close to A. rubripes, but their relationship is still in need of investigation.
200003757 | The name "Athyrium brevifrons Naki" used for this taxon in FRPS (3(2): 162. 1999) was ascribed to Kitagawa (Rep. First Sci. Exped. Manchoukuo Sect. 4(2): 75. 1935), but that is a nomen nudum, as are most other citations given in FRPS. However, by including the valid taxon A. filix-femina (Linnaeus) Roth var. longipes as a synonym, Tagawa effectively validated the binomial Athyrium brevifrons Nakai ex Tagawa. The name A. multidentatum (Döll) Ching, based on Aspidium filix-femina Swartz var. multidentatum Döll, has been included within this taxon and would have priority, but Ching indicated that the inclusion was based on a misapplication of the name by Fomin (Fl. Sibir. Orient. Extremi 5: 108. 1930). Dölls protologue has not been seen, but if, as seems likely, it was based on European material Chings interpretation would seem correct. "Athyrium extensum" (Ching in Y. L. Zhang et al., Sporae Pterid. Sin. 209. 1976) belongs here but was not validly published because no Latin description or diagnosis, or reference to such, was provided (Melbourne Code, Art. 39.1).

242307035 | Liu et al. (Fern Fl. Taiwan, 50. 2009) argue that Athyrium foliolosum does not occur in Taiwan, where it is replaced by the similar A. tripinnatum.
242307035 | The specific epithet was based on "Asplenium foliolosum" (Wallich, Numer. List, no. 2205. 1830), which is a nomen nudum and was not therefore validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)). Wallichs no. 2205 included several specimens with different collection details. Some, with purplish rachises and small indusia, match Athyrium fimbriatum, whereas others, with stramineous rachises and large indusia, belong to A. foliolosum. "Aspidium squarrosum" (Wallich, Numer. List, no. 356. 1829), not D. Don (1825), is another nomen nudum that belongs here.

250098528 | J. Z. Wang and S. H. Li (in P. Y. Fu et al., Clav. Pl. Chin. Bor.-Orient. 35. 1995) considered that Athyrium rupestre Kodama occurs in Jilin. It is characterized by the perispore surface without folds and the pinnae pinnatipartite to pinnatisect, less than 1 cm wide, and long acuminate. Athyrium rupestre is distributed in Hokkaido and N Honshu, Japan, and E Russia. If the identification by J. Z. Wang and S. H. Li (1995) is correct, the species should be new to China.

200003832 | Athyrium sinense is very similar to A. dentigerum in frond morphology; it differs from A. dentigerum by the 2 or 3(or 4) pairs of shortened basal pinnae.
200003832 | Athyrium filix-femina (Linnaeus) Roth s.l. of China occurs widely from NE to SW China. In fact, it included A. brevifrons, A. sinense, and A. dentigerum. Mature plants of the three species differ morphologically and geographically. Athyrium brevifrons occurs in NE and N China; only the basal 1 or 2 pairs of pinnae are slightly shortened, and the stipes are relatively markedly long. Athyrium dentigerum occurs in SW China; its numerous lower pinnae are gradually shortened toward the base, and the stipes are very short. Qin Ling plants of A. sinense are morphologically and geographically intermediate between A. brevifrons and A. dentigerum: in A. sinense several pairs of pinnae are slightly shortened toward the base. The three are probably subspecies of one species, pending further analysis. All three species are different from European A. filix-femina.

India, t. 221. 1867 (Type K!); Deparia allantodioides (Beddome) Kato) from N India, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, and Taiwan. The chromosome number reports from India were diploid or tetraploid, 2n = 80 or 160. But the spores of the type specimens in K are unequal in size, rounded, black, abortive, which shows it should be a hybrid, Lunathyrium ×allantodioides (Z. R. Wang, Fl. Reipubl.

200003186 | Cibotium barometz is rather common in S subtropical regions and tropical regions, usually growing with Alsophila spinulosa, Diplopterygium chinense, and Dicranopteris pedata, sometimes abundant and forming a dense community. It is an indicator species of acidic soils in tropical and subtropical areas, mainly distributed in S and SW China, primarily in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou, but also in Sichuan and Yunnan. The most northerly distribution of this species in China reaches the Chang Jiang in Chongqing.
200003186 | The rhizome of this plant is very thick, woody, and covered by long, soft, golden-yellow hairs, appearing like a golden-haired dog. Therefore, the plant is called "Jinmao Gouji" (golden hair dog), or "Huanggoutou" (yellow dogs head) in China. It is a famous traditional Chinese herbal medicine known as "Gouji" (cibot rhizome, "rhizoma cibotii"). Hairs of the rhizome and stipe are also used as a wound dressing and to stanch blood loss. It is listed in CITES Appendix II. Conservation and sustainable use should be attained.

242412884 | One of us (Nooteboom) notes that, according to B. J. Hoshizaki (pers. comm.) and personal observations, several of the species treated here as synonyms behave as good species in cultivation. However, after studying over 400 different collections of the entire area, it is clear that they all belong to one species. That does not exclude that different forms from different localities intergrade in nature but behave differently in cultivation. It would be best to give these forms cultivar names (Mariesii and Stenolepis). As soon as a plant is cultivated and vegetatively propagated it forms a clone of similar plants that can be recognized from other clones of the same species. Formally naming the forms according to the rules of nomenclature means that quite a lot of collections cannot be named. As the spores of all the forms are also extremely similar, there is no doubt as to their conspecificity.

200004834 | Humata repens is a very variable species. All the forms have in common the same spores, which vary in size because of polyploidy. The H. repens group, and probably the entire Humata clade in Tsutsumi, X. C. Zhang and Kato (Syst. Bot. 33: 44-48. 2008), is as far as we know polyploid and (?entirely) apomictic. Both H. trifoliata and H. vestita belong to this group. While H. trifoliata often is a young stage of H. repens (later in time more developed and more divided leaves may appear on the same rhizome), H. vestita is more recognizable when mature and is probably one of the sterile clones that so often occur within the H. repens group. In Peninsular Malaysia, H. vestita grows at higher elevations than other H. repens, but this has not been observed in China. It seems acceptable to distinguish H. vestita as merely a form of H. repens.

200004841 | One of us (Nooteboom) considers that although Ching (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 11: 20. 1966) recognized two species, Paradavallodes chingiae and P. membranulosa, careful examination of the types leads to the conclusion that there is only one, easily recognizable species, i.e., P. membranulosa. However, two of us (Xing and Wang) do not support P. chingiae as a synonym of P. membranulosa on account of differences in the leaf texture and pubescence. In addition, according to scanning electron microscope observations, the spore ornamentation of P. chingiae is lophate, whereas that of P. membranulosa is verrucate.

200004316 | According to Fraser-Jenkins, the correct name of this fern should be Arachniodes cornucervi (D. Don) Fraser-Jenkins (Taxon. Revis. Indian Subcontinental Pteridophytes, 323. 2008) and the name adopted here is a misapplication and should stand for the group of ferns for which we use the name A. coniifolia, the following species. Without seeing the lectotype chosen by Fraser-Jenkins, we cannot determine if his interpretation of D. Dons name is better than Chings.
200004316 | This is a rather variable fern in frond size, lamina shape, and margin of ultimate segments in different habitats; it also shows to some extent morphological differences among fertile and sterile fronds or pinnae of the same frond. The sterile frond or pinnae often have a wider lamina or pinnules and longer awns along the ultimate segments.

250098612 | This species had been referred to Cyrtomium nervosum Ching & K. H. Shing (Fraser-Jenkins, Pakistan Syst. 5: 85-120. 1992; Kung et al., FRPS 5(2): 214. 2001) until Fraser-Jenkinss new combination.
250098612 | There is cytological evidence showing that Cyrtomium brevicuneatum, C. kansuense, C. kungshanense, C. neocaryotideum, C. nervosum, and C. yuanum are all conspecific with C. anomophyllum. While C. brevicuneatum, C. kungshanense, and C. yuanum are the sexual forms, C. kansuense, C. neocaryotideum, and C. nervosum are apomictic forms (Matsumoto et al., 5th Symp. Asian Pteridol. Fern Show: Progr. & Abstr. 2010).
250098612 | The sexual diploids have been discovered only in Sichuan and Yunnan, while apomictic triploids are spread all over the region. This implies that Cyrtomium anomophyllum may have originated in SW China and became dispersed throughout Sino-Japanese, Sino-Himalayan regions and India following the evolution of apomictic forms (Matsumoto et al., loc. cit.).
250098612 | Two myricetin glycosides, the 3-O-glucoside and the 3-O-rhamnosylglucoside, were isolated from Japanese samples of Cyrtomium anomophyllum. However, they were absent from Nepalese, Taiwanese, mainland Chinese, and Pakistani samples, implying the heterogeneity in chemical constituents between the Japanese populations and those in the remaining regions.
250098612 | This species is intermediate between Cyrtomium caryotideum and the entire (or rarely weakly toothed at the apices) C. macrophyllum. It is distinguished by its lower pinnae being very rounded and often bent at their basiscopic bases, with the margins rather weakly toothed, mainly toward the apices, sometimes becoming entire below (Fraser-Jenkins, Taxon. Revis. Indian Subcontinental Pteridophytes, 330. 2008).
250098612 | Cyrtomium maximum Ching & K. H. Shing (Acta Phytotax. Sin., Addit. 1: 44. 1965), described from Simao, S Yunnan, is based on a single sterile frond. It is most similar to C. anomophyllum, but more studies are needed.

200004339 | Cyrtomium devexiscapulae is similar to C. falcatum and is sometimes regarded as a variety of the latter. Flavanones are found in C. devexiscapulae but not in C. falcatum. This implies that these two should be treated as different species.
200004339 | This species is a sexual tetraploid. Matsumoto (Ann. Tsukuba Bot. Gard. 22: 1-141. 2003) suggested that Cyrtomium falcatum is one of the potential progenitors of the allotetraploid C. devexiscapulae. Lu et al. (J. Plant Res. 118: 129-135. 2005) further proposed that C. falcatum is likely the female parent of C. devexiscapulae based on the shared chloroplast sequences.

Crucifilix, grows in (sandstone) acidic soils, and occurs in S Chongqing, NE and SE Guizhou (but not in S Guizhou), and NW Hunan, while P. leveillei does not have extraordinarily prolonged basalmost pinnae, is a member of P. sect. Haplopolystichum, grows in (limestone) basic soils, and occurs in S Guizhou only.
242340584 | Although often cited as a homotypic synonym of Polystichum leveillei, Hemesteum leveillei Christ (in Léveillé, Fl. Kouy-Tchéou, 497. 1915; cited as "Hemesteum leveillei (C. Christensen) H. Léveillé" in FRPS 5(2): 175. 2001) did not include the type specimen of P. leveillei (J. Esquirol 2223), which instead was cited by H. Léveillé for H. obliquum (loc. cit.: 498). This suggests that H. Léveillé considered H. leveillei Christ and P. leveillei C. Christensen to be different species.
242340584 | The diagnostic characters of Polystichum leveillei include its slender stipe, thin but hard pinnae often with 1 or more free lobes, and complete absence of teeth or spinules on lobe.

200003039 | Dicranopteris pedata cannot be distinguished from D. linearis with any clear discriminative characters. The Japanese form is easily included in the range of variable forms of so-called D. linearis, and no infraspecific taxa are recognized under that variable species in the present treatment.
200003039 | Dicranopteris linearis is widely distributed in tropical areas of S Asia and is sometimes an invasive weed. It is very variable, and Holttum (Fl. Males., Ser. 2, 1: 33-36. 1959) recognized thirteen varieties, four of which have been reported in Taiwan: D. linearis var. linearis, D. linearis var. montana (here treated under D. taiwanensis), D. linearis var. subpectinata, and D. linearis var. tetraphylla. These were separated by the presence or absence of hairs on the pinnules, rachis dichotomies equal or unequal, presence or absence of lateral pinnae subtending the ultimate pinnae, and dimensions of the pinnae (Fl. Taiwan, ed. 2, 1: 92-94. 1994); however, we believe that these vary too continuously to justify the recognition of distinct taxa.
200003039 | The status of Gleichenia linearis var. longicauda Christ (Bull. Herb. Boissier 7: 19. 1899), described from Yunnan, is uncertain.

200003041 | Dicranopteris taiwanensis was reported as the only species in Dicranopteris that has apical buds covered only by hairs, not by bracts. Further field studies (Ralf Knapp, pers. comm.) have shown that there are bracts though these are small and fugacious. This removes the main distinction from D. linearis var. montana and extends the distribution outside Taiwan.

250098270 | Lindsaea hainaniana is morphologically very similar to L. lobata var. lobata, differing only in the upper pinnules being gradually reduced in L. lobata var. lobata but ± suddenly reduced in L. hainaniana. A recent molecular analysis (Lehtonen et al., Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 163: 305-359. 2010) found, however, that L. lobata in the traditional sense was polyphyletic and this resulted in the recognition of the variety at the species level. Lindsaea hainaniana also resembles L. cultrata, from which it mainly differs in having wider rhizome scales and upper margins of the pinnae more deeply lobed.

200003305 | Lindsaea orbiculata is very variable, and it is possibly a complex. The typical form (stipes 5-10 cm, lamina 1-pinnate, pinnae orbicular or flabellate, and sori marginal, continuous) is found on the one hand, and on the other is the form known as L. hainanensis (stipes up to 28 cm, fully 2-pinnate, and pinnules rhomboid). The two forms appear very distinct, but there is a series of transitional specimens known. Two cytotypes, diploid and tetraploid, were reported for L. orbiculata. Further taxonomic studies at the population level of this taxon are needed.

200002754 | The angles between branches and stems of Lycopodium japonicum are an unreliable character. The leaf shapes can vary too from one population to another depending upon the habitat. Thus, L. centrochinense, L. interjectum, L. kinabaluense, L. pseudoclavatum var. yunnanense, L. simulans, and L. taliense should be merged into L. japonicum.
200002754 | Lycopodium japonicum, occurring in E and S Asia, is often misidentified as the European L. clavatum Linnaeus (e.g., Nakaike, New Fl. Japan, 17. 1982; J. L. Tsai & W. C. Shieh, Fl. Taiwan, ed. 2, 1: 31. 1994).

242337168 | In 1982, Ching twice described the same lycophyte species under the names Lycopodium mingcheense (Fl. Fujian. 1: 619. Apr 1982; the original "minchegense" spelling being a correctable error) and Phlegmariurus mingcheensis. Phlegmariurus mingcheensis cannot be taken as a combination based on L. mingcheense because in the original publication a different holotype was indicated and the name L. mingcheense was not mentioned. The correct names for this species in Huperzia, Lycopodium, and Phlegmariurus are Huperzia mingcheensis (Ching) Holub (basionym: Phlegmariurus mingcheensis), Lycopodium mingcheense Ching, and Phlegmariurus mingcheensis Ching, respectively. The lectotypification of the name Lycopodium mingcheense using P. S. Chiu 2069 (PE) by Xiang et al. (Taxon 52: 857-858. 2003) was redundant since this specimen was clearly indicated as the holotype in Chings original publication. The replacement name Phlegmariurus mingjoui (X. C. Zhang, Higher Pl. China 2: 20. 2008) is an illegitimate superfluous name (see Li Bing Zhang, Taxon 61: 665-666. 2012).
242337168 | This species is similar to Phlegmariurus petiolatus, but its leaves are lanceolate (not elliptic-lanceolate) and sessile.

242303401 | Because this is the first species described in the genus Angiopteris, it has found a very broad application in the past. The species is here treated in its strict sense with a Pacific distribution (see Christenhusz & Toivonen, Biol. Invas. 10: 1215-1228. 2008), and it can be recognized by its very obvious false veins and its rather large leaves to 5 m. This remains a species complex, however, and more studies at population level and possibly horticultural experiments will be needed to resolve this.

250098234 | The name Angiopteris paucinervis was originally published by Chu and He (Acta Bot. Yunnan. 22: 399. 2000) but not validly so because the type was not explicitly indicated (Melbourne Code, Art. 40.6). Later, Jin and Chen (loc. cit.) cited "W. M. Chu et al.. ..... 18358. (Typus: PYU)," provided a full and direct reference to Hes Latin description and diagnosis, and ascribed the name to "W. M. Chu et Z. R. He ex Z. R. He" thereby validly publishing the name, which should be attributed to W. M. Chu & Z. R. He (Art. 46.2 and Note 2).

200002967 | It has been suggested that Angiopteris sparsisora is of hybrid origin because it putatively is intermediate between Angiopteris and the formerly independent Archangiopteris, but this has not yet been proven to be the case. This species is, however, one of the reasons why it is difficult to draw a clear morphological distinction between the two genera, and (apart from the molecular evidence provided by Murdock, Amer. J. Bot. 95: 626-641. 2008) it is a further reason to merge Archangiopteris with Angiopteris.

200002976 | This and the next two species (Angiopteris lygodiifolia and A. hainanensis) share numerous characters and are often difficult to tell apart. It appears that they form a grade from larger plants (up to 3 m) with submarginal sori in the Himalaya (A. wallichiana) to smaller plants with near-medial sori in Taiwan and Japan (A. lygodiifolia). There are intermediate specimens known from Hainan, and, therefore, it may be difficult to maintain these taxa as distinct. They were maintained here because A. lygodiifolia is in common use and would be diverted into synonymy if these species were merged, and they may be separated on the basis of geography. Further studies at the population level are needed to resolve this species complex.
200002976 | Angiopteris fauriei Hieronymus var. formosana Hieronymus (Hedwigia 61(3): 274. 1919) was included as a synonym of A. henryi in FRPS (2: 36. 1959). If correct, this would add Taiwan to the distribution of A. wallichiana.

200004897 | Lepisorus longus was distinguished from L. affinis by its narrow fronds. The widths of fronds are variable even on one rhizome, and the rhizome scales, epidermis, and spore ornamentation show very little difference; thus, L. longus is treated as a synonym of L. affinis.

200004900 | Lepisorus bicolor is very common in montane forests in SW China, particularly Yunnan. The rhizome scales are of two types: those on the mature rhizome are very small and closely appressed; those at the rhizome apex are much larger and lanceolate. The bicolored scales resemble those of the following species, but L. morrisonensis has the rhizome concealed by uniformly large scales with white, not brown, margins.

200004901 | A very wide interpretation has been taken for Lepisorus clathratus ± following Fraser-Jenkins (Taxon. Revis. Indian Subcontinental Pteridophytes, 41-42. 2008) as accepted by Li Wang et al. (Phylogeography of the Sino-Himalayan Fern Lepisorus clathratus on "The Roof of the World." 2011. PLoS ONE 6(9): e25896. doi:10.1371/journal.pone. 0025896; accessed 28 May 2012).
200004901 | Lepisorus soulieanus had been placed in a different genus, Platygyria, on the basis of the distinctive sporangium annulus of broad, pale, thin-walled cells, but this is not a consistent feature with some collections showing a range from these to normal leptosporangiate annuli. There are no other characters that allow a clear separation between the two taxa. Lepisorus petiolatus was primarily separated on the basis of the long slender stipe, but this also is a very variable feature with no obvious discontinuity to justify the recognition of distinct taxa.

242328959 | Lepisorus kawakamii has often been treated as a synonym of L. megasorus. The two species can be distinguished as follows: in L. kawakamii the lamina is linear-lanceolate, the rhizome scales are usually ovate or acuminately ovate with entire margins, and the paraphyses are small, thin, and pale brown, while in L. megasorus the lamina is lanceolate, widest near the base, the rhizome scales are lanceolate with denticulate margins, and the paraphyses are relatively large, thick and brown. Sometimes, the scales in L. kawakamii are lanceolate, but the linear-lanceolate lamina, thin paraphyses, and much closer sori are reliable markers for this species.

200004927 | Lepisorus pseudoussuriensis is most closely related to the preceding species, L. ussuriensis. They can be distinguished easily by the paraphyses, the former has these with square transparent lumina, which are very rare in this genus. These two species also have different distributions.
200004928 | 棕鳞瓦韦 zong lin wa wei 
200004928 | Lepisorus excavatus (Bory ex Willdenow) Ching var. scolopendrium Buchanan-Hamilton ex Ching, Bull. Fan Mem. Inst. Biol. 4: 69. 1933, based on Polypodium scolopendrium Buchanan-Hamilton ex D. Don, Prodr. Fl. Nepal. 1. 1825, not P. scolopendria N. L. Burman, Fl. Indica, 232. 1768; Drynaria sesquipedalis J. Smith, nom. illeg. superfl.; Lepisorus paleparaphysus Y. X. Lin; L. sesquipedalis Fraser-Jenkins, nom. illeg. superfl.; L. virescens Ching & S. K. Wu; Pleopeltis scolopendrium (Buchanan-Hamilton ex Ching) Alston & Bonner; Polypodium excavatum Bory ex Willdenow var. concolor Takeda.
200004928 | Plants 15-30 cm tall. Rhizomes creeping, strong, 3-6 mm in diam., densely scaly; scales appressed, brown, lanceolate, 4-6 × 0.8-3 mm, thin in texture, margin entire, apex acuminate; lumina subsquare and transparent. Fronds 0.2-2 cm apart; stipe straw-colored, 2-3(-5) cm, 1-2 mm in diam., sparsely scaly at base; lamina reddish brown on both surfaces when dried, narrowly lanceolate, 12-45 × (1-)1.5-4.5 cm, widest at or below middle, herbaceous or thinly papery, abaxially with small, lanceolate, scales on costa, bicolored, margin ± flat, straight or slightly undulate, apex acute or long caudate-acuminate; costa raised on both sides, veinlets slightly visible. Sori usually along distal half of lamina, close to costa, orbicular or elliptic, 2-3 mm in diam.; paraphyses usually brown, sometimes colorless on immature fronds, orbicular, 0.5-0.7 mm in diam., margin entire.
200004928 | On tree trunks or rocks in forests; (500-)1400-2800(-3200) m. Guizhou, Hainan, Sichuan, ?Taiwan, Xizang, Yunnan [Bhutan, N India, Nepal].
200004928 | The original name, Polypodium scolopendrium, must be considered a homonym of P. scolopendria, the basionym of Phymatosorus scolopendria (N. L. Burman) Pichi Sermolli. The epithet was validated at varietal rank by Ching and later elevated to species rank by Mehra and Bir. Smith published Drynaria sesquipedalis as an intended new name for Polypodium scolopendrium Buchanan-Hamilton ex D. Don, not of N. L. Burman, but included Pleopeltis nuda Hooker, thus making it illegitimate. Fraser-Jenkins missed this when publishing Lepisorus sesquipedalis to use for this taxon. Bir and Trikha (Amer. Fern J. 64(2): 54. 1974) chose L. leiopteris (Kunze) Bir & Trikha as the name for this taxon, but Fraser-Jenkins (Taxon. Revis. Indian Subcontinental Pteridophytes, 38. 2008) claims that Polypodium leiopteris is a synonym of L. nudus.
200004928 | Lepisorus virescens was separated from L. scolopendrium by having the lamina less than 20 cm, thin in texture, and with narrowly attenuate base merging into an indistinct stipe and the plagiotropic, oblong sori, closer to the costa than to the margin. We checked more specimens and observed living plants and found that there is considerable variation in these leaf characters, such that they cannot be used to distinguish taxa. Lepisorus virescens is just a juvenile form of L. scolopendrium. Lepisorus paleparaphysus was distinguished from L. scolopendrium by the nearly colorless paraphyses. We checked more specimens and found colorless paraphyses present within other species of this section, especially in immature laminae.

242328996 | Plants 5-25 cm tall. Rhizomes creeping, 1.5-2 mm in diam., densely scaly; scales brown, iridescent, lanceolate or ovate-lanceolate, 1-1.3 × 0.3-0.45 mm, margin dentate, apex attenuate but not filiform, central part with ± opaque band, marginal lumina large and transparent. Fronds 0.2-2 cm apart; stipe straw-colored, 1-3 cm, 1-1.5 mm in diam.; lamina pale brown, pale grayish, or greenish, lanceolate, 15-30 × (0.2-)0.7-2 cm, widest 1/3-1/2 from base, papery or thickly papery when dried, both surfaces glabrous or with scattered orbicular or lanceolate scales, base attenuate, decurrent, apex long caudate; costa raised, veinlets obscure or slightly visible. Sori linear, on abruptly attenuate distal 1/3(-1/2) of lamina, close to margin, linear, sometimes lower part interrupted; paraphyses orbicular, sometimes slightly stellate, 2.5-3.5 mm in diam., transparent, lumina irregular.
242328996 | On moss-covered tree trunks or rocks in evergreen broad-leaved forests; 1200-1900(-3600) m. SE Yunnan [Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam].
242328996 | Lepisorus sinensis is a very distinct species that can be easily recognized by the linear sori. Lepisorus vittarioides is only known from the type specimen, which Ching cited when he described L. sinensis, and it differs from L. sinensis by the narrow lamina. We found there were no other differences between these two species. "Vittaria henryi" is a nomen nudum cited in the protologue of L. vittarioides and was not therefore validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)).

242328999 | Polypodium sordidum C. Christensen, Contr. U.S. Natl. Herb. 26: 320. 1931; Lepisorus sordidus f. rostrata Ching.
242328999 | Plants 20-40 cm tall. Rhizomes shortly creeping, 2.5-3 mm in diam., densely scaly; scales narrowly lanceolate, 2.5-4 × 0.5-1 mm; lumina usually thick and totally opaque, sometimes thin and transparent.

Sori restricted to distal 1/3 on narrow distal part of lamina, orbicular, ca. 4 mm in diam., midway between costa and margins; paraphyses dark brown, peltate, rounded-stellate, 0.2-0.3 mm in diam., margin with long and strong spines; lumina opaque, thick and dark colored, or thin and brown.
242328999 | On trunks of broad-leaved trees beside streams; 1200-1400 m. Sichuan, Yunnan [India].
242328999 | Lepisorus sordidus is a very rare species in China. The dark and opaque rhizome scales and stellate paraphyses are as in L. medogensis, but it differs by the broadly lanceolate leaves. The collections from Mt. Emei usually have the scales and paraphyses thin and brown in color.

200004932 | ● On rocks or tree trunks; 2000-2800 m. Henan, Qinghai, Shaanxi.
200004932 | Lepisorus thaipaiensis is very similar to L. likiangensis but is found at lower elevations, has a much thinner lamina, and sori usually distributed along distal 1/3-1/2 of lamina while those of L. likiangensis can extend almost to the base.

242329008 | Lepisorus niger Ching; L. pseudoangustus Ching.
242329008 | Plants 15-35 cm tall. Rhizomes creeping, 1.5-2.5 mm in diam., densely scaly; scales brown with pale margins, linear-lanceolate, 3-5 × 0.7-1.2 mm, margin entire or denticulate, apex often long and filiform, opaque except for marginal 1 or 2 rows of paler, transparent lumina. Fronds 0.5-1.5 cm apart; stipe straw-colored, 1-5 cm, 1-1.5 mm in diam., base with 3 vascular bundles arranged in a triangle; lamina grayish green to grayish yellow, linear-lanceolate to lanceolate, 12-33 × 0.5-1.8 cm, widest at middle, thinly leathery when dried, sparsely scaly, scales small, opaque or transparent, base attenuate, long decurrent, margin straight or slightly revolute, apex long caudate; costa raised on both sides, veinlets obscure. Sori on distal 1/2-2/3 of lamina, midway between costa and margins, orbicular or elliptic, 2-4 mm in diam.; paraphyses brown, suborbicular, 0.3-0.5 mm in diam., margin entire; lumina dense, center thickened, opaque or transparent. Spore surface deeply and sparsely foveolate.
242329008 | ● On tree trunks or in rock crevices in dense forests; 1900-3700 m. Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan.
242329008 | Lepisorus contortus, L. thunbergianus, and L. tibeticus are widely distributed species in China, closely allied to each other and very difficult to distinguish. Lepisorus tibeticus is relatively large with laminae usually 22-33 cm, whereas the lamina is not more than 18 cm in L. thunbergianus. The rhizome scales of L. thunbergianus are linear-lanceolate, and opaque except for one or two rows of transparent lumina at margin, while the scales of L. contortus have a broad base and are transparent except for one or two rows of opaque lumina in center. We checked more specimens and found L. contortus and L. thunbergianus to be altitudinally vicarious, the former at higher elevations relative to the latter. Lepisorus tibeticus is a more difficult species to define: the scales are linear-lanceolate, often with a long and filiform apex, while the size of the opaque center varies continuously with elevation. For convenience we have treated the specimens from montane forest in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xizang as L. tibeticus.

200004935 | Plants 15-30 cm tall. Rhizomes short and decumbent, less than 3 cm, 2-3 mm in diam., apex densely scaly, remainder soon naked; scales basifixed, deep brown with paler margins, iridescent when young, lanceolate or broadly lanceolate, 2-3.5 × 0.7-1.1 mm; most lumina opaque, marginal 1 or 2 rows of cells brownish, transparent. Fronds clustered; stipe straw-colored, 1-3(-5) cm, 1-1.5 mm in diam.; lamina brownish or grayish green when dried, lanceolate or linear-lanceolate, both ends attenuate, (10-)13-20 × 1-2 cm, widest at middle, leathery, both surfaces glabrous, base cuneate, decurrent, apex acuminate; costa raised on both sides, veinlets obscure. Sori on distal half of lamina, costular, rarely midway between costa and margins, orbicular, 3-7 mm in diam.; paraphyses orbicular, brownish with central lumina small and opaque or iridescent with lumina large and transparent. Spore surface foveolate.

200004935 | This is a very difficult species to define, and many specimens have been misidentified as Lepisorus thunbergianus. We found that L. tosaensis can be distinguished from L. thunbergianus by the short rhizome, iridescent young scales, and much larger transparent lumina of the leaf scales. This species is always distributed at elevations less than 1000 m, while L. thunbergianus is found at relatively higher elevations.
200004935 | Lepisorus paohuashanensis differs from L. tosaensis by the much smaller fronds, 3-7 × 0.4-0.6 cm, but this is just an extreme form within variable populations.

242329013 | Hemsley (J. Linn. Soc., Bot. 35: 206. 1902) treated material of this species as Polypodium hastatum Thunberg.
242329013 | Platygyria inaequibasis was separated by Zhang et al (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 41: 401-415. 2003) on the basis of the less-developed lamina base, rather broader rhizome scales, and lanceolate paraphyses with more regular lumina. The considerable variation within Lepisorus waltonii is such that we have followed Yu and Lin (Acta Phytotax. Sin. 35: 343. 1997) who included that species within L. waltonii.

242339792 | While Rödl-Linder (Blumea 34(2): 391. 1990) treated material of this species (Polypodiodes chinensis) as a hairy variety of the following species (P. amoena), Fraser-Jenkins (Taxon. Revis. Indian Subcontinental Pteridophytes, 43. 2008) suggested that it merely represents more hairy populations of P. amoena not worthy of formal recognition; he also indicated that he regards Polypodium yunnanense Franchet as part of this taxon if recognized as a distinct species and thus providing the oldest species epithet. However, the concept used here is based on a different set of characters from those discussed by Fraser-Jenkins. The names Polypodium pseudo-amoenum Ching and Polypodiodes pseudo-amoenum (Ching) Ching have been applied to this taxon but have never been validated. The former was first mentioned as a synonym in the protologue of Polypodium amoenum var. chinense (Christ) Ching. The name Polypodium pseudo-amoenum var. pilosum Ching is also invalid (Melbourne Code, Art. 35.1).

Stipe straw-colored, 1-4 cm, slender, glabrous; lamina pinnatisect, triangular in outline, 4-8 × 3-6 cm, base cordate, margin with up to 2 mm aristate teeth. Lateral lobes 1 or 2 pairs, lowest pair curved, deflexed at base, bending at apex, spreading or slightly ascending further up, 2-3 × 1-1.5 cm, apex obtuse or acute. Lateral veins distinct, veinlets hardly visible. Lamina herbaceous, both surfaces glabrous. Sori near costa.
250098807 | Epiphytic on tree trunks or on rocks; 2800-3700 m. Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan [Bhutan, N India, Nepal].
250098807 | The material here included within Selliguea albidoglauca was treated as Phymatopteris malacodon (= S. malacodon) in FRPS. It differs from the type of that species by the lack of the aristate marginal teeth of the lamina, characteristic of S. malacodon s.s. Chinese material of the true S. malacodon was named P. cartilagineoserrata.
250098807 | The choice of epithet for this taxon depends on the priority of Polypodium austrosinicum Christ versus P. austrosinicum Christ ex C. Christensen (a replacement name for P. henryi Christ, here treated as a synonym of Microsorum fortunei (T. Moore) Ching), both published in 1906. The only direct indication of priority is the action of Christensen who claimed priority for the latter, published in his own work, and published the replacement name P. albidoglaucum for the former. In the absence of other information on the exact publication dates, this has to be accepted, and the correct epithet for this taxon is that of Christensen.

200003544 | There has been controversy as to the correct name of this taxon. Pichi Sermolli (Webbia 12: 665. 1957) lectotypified Adiantum philippense with the illustration "Adiantum Philippense, folio rotundo laciniato" in Petiver (Gazophyl. Nat., 8, t. 4, f. 4, 1702-1709). Some (e.g., Morton in Contr. U. S. Natl. Herb. 38: 370. 1974; Verdcourt, Fl. Trop. East Africa: 58. 2002) have argued that this illustration is unidentifiable and might not even be a fern. Fraser-Jenkins (Taxon. Revis. Indian Subcontinental Pteridophytes, 144. 2008) claims that Petivers drawing was copied from a drawing sent to him by Kamel and that the original drawing and herbarium material upon which it was based are available in the Sloane Herbarium (BM) and prove that A. philippense is indeed this species. Verma and Fraser-Jenkins (in S. C. Verma, S. P. Khullar & Cheema, Perspec. Pterido. 82-83. 2009, fidé Fraser-Jenkins, loc. cit.) recognized two further subspecies: the diploid sexual subsp. teestae S. C. Verma & Fraser-Jenkins in which they included Chinese material, the diploid and tetraploid apomictic subsp. intermedium S. C. Verma & Fraser-Jenkins, and epitypified subsp. philippense with material of a known triploid apomict from India.

250098301 | This beautiful species is distinguished from its relatives by its large fronds and poorly developed false indusia. Fée listed Aleuritopteris dealbata and A. farinosa (Forsskål) Fée as distinct taxa in his diagnosis of his new genus Aleuritopteris on p. 153. One must presume therefore that when he cited Cheilanthes farinosa Hooker & Greville (Icon. Filic. 2: t. 134. 1831) as a synonym of his A. dealbata, he implicitly restricted their account to the Nepalese element. This was first invalidly described by D. Don and validated by C. Presl, who included Hooker and Grevilles account within his concept of the taxon. Fées name was incorrectly treated as invalid by recent Asian authors, but their replacement name, A. doniana, must be treated as a superfluous illegitimate name.

242302114 | Aleuritopteris ebenipes is similar to A. veitchii in its lamina being covered with milky yellow farina abaxially but differs in its bicolorous scales with brown, narrow margins, which in some specimens can be difficult to detect. The difference noted in couplet 3 of the key of the triangular-ovate lamina in A. ebenipes (vs. pentagonal in A. veitchii) also may provide a clue for distinguishing these two species. However, some specimens can be difficult to assign to one or the other of these taxa. Further research is needed on separation of A. ebenipes from A. veitchii.

242302122 | The name Aleuritopteris stenochlamys refers to populations occurring from N India and C Nepal to SW China (Sichuan, Yunnan, Xizang) at elevations below ca. 3000 m. These plants have relatively large fronds and seem to differ from typical A. grisea in their spores (cristate-reticulate vs. echinate-rugulate). Aleuritopteris grisea s.l. likely represents a species complex that requires more detailed study to tease apart its cryptic component taxa.

242302127 | Rock crevices on slopes or cliffs; 1800-2700 m. Taiwan [Japan, Thailand].
242302127 | The status of the Taiwanese endemic Aleuritopteris agetae remains unresolved. This taxon is said to differ from A. krameri s.s. in its milky yellow (vs. white) farina and stipe scales that are sometimes slightly bicolorous. Ralf Knapp (pers. comm.), the author of a recent authoritative guide to the pteridophytes of Taiwan, Ferns and Fern Allies of Taiwan (2011), has stated that where the two taxa grow together they are readily distinguishable in the field. However, based on examination of herbarium material collected in Taiwan, the present authors could not consistently discern two discrete morphological entities. Some of the specimens from mainland China also appear to have milky-colored farina. The situation requires further study.

Hieronymus did not designate a type when he published the species. Indian scholars Dixit and Das (Proc. Ind. Acad. Sci. 88(B): II. 263. 1979) chose the duplicate of Meebold 2587, a hairy lamina specimen, as the lectotype of var. intermedia.

Cryptogramma raddeana has been treated as a variety or subspecies of C. brunoniana, but plastid DNA data resolve each of the two taxa as well-supported clades that are reciprocally monophyletic to one another and have a level of genetic differentiation similar to other interspecific divergences in the genus (Metzgar, unpubl. data). They also differ in slight but consistent morphological differences (e.g., lamina dissection, pinnule shape). Combined, this suggests that they are distinct though closely related species. Perceived intergradation between related taxa in Cryptogramma can be due either to formation of sterile hybrids (Alverson, Biosyst. Parsley-Ferns, MS thesis, Oregon State University. 1989) or to the presence of fronds that are developmentally intermediate between sterile and fertile fronds, which obscure the differences between taxa in frond dissection and segment shape (Hultén, Fl. Aleutian Islands. 397pp. 1937).

200003469 | Cryptogramma raddeana has been treated as a variety or subspecies of C. brunoniana, but plastid DNA data resolve each of the two taxa as well-supported clades that are reciprocally monophyletic to one another and have a level of genetic differentiation similar to other interspecific divergences in the genus (Metzgar, unpubl. data). They also differ in slight but consistent morphological differences (e.g., lamina dissection, pinnule shape). Combined, this suggests that they are distinct though closely related species. Perceived intergradation between related taxa in Cryptogramma can be due either to formation of sterile hybrids (Alverson, Biosyst. Parsley-Ferns, MS thesis, Oregon State University. 1989) or to the presence of fronds that are developmentally intermediate between sterile and fertile fronds, which obscure the differences between taxa in frond dissection and segment shape (Hultén, Fl. Aleutian Islands. 397pp. 1937).

242413319 | Iwatsuki et al. (Fl. Japan 1: 87. 1995) treated Vittaria anguste-elongata as a synonym of V. ensiformis Swartz (Haplopteris ensiformis (Swartz) E. H. Crane), which is widely distributed in the Old World tropics. However, Knapp (Ferns Fern Allies Taiwan, 426, 482. 2011) reports that some populations in S Taiwan (southernmost tip of Ping Dong County) have a narrower, more leathery lamina and rhizome scales with fewer, larger cells than material of H. anguste-elongata from other areas in Taiwan and probably represent H. ensiformis s.s.

Onychium cryptogrammoides resembles O. japonicum but differs in its black stipe bases, finely divided lamina, and more slender costae and costules. The two species have different distributions. The name O. contiguum Wallich ex C. Hope has been applied to this taxon in much of the literature on Asian pteridophytes, but that epithet is a nom. illeg. superfl. for the taxon here treated as O. japonicum var. lucidum, as the basionym Leptostegia lucida D. Don was cited in synonymy in the protologue.

200003374 | Pteris sinensis was proposed as a replacement name for P. inaequalis Baker in the belief that this was a later homonym of P. inaequalis C. Presl (Tent. Pterid. 145. 1836).

200002824 | Rain forests in limestone areas; 100-500 m. S Yunnan [N Vietnam].
200002824 | Selaginella superba was treated as a synonym of S. frondosa Warburg but can be distinguished from the latter by the much larger leaves. It is the most beautiful species of the Chinese Selaginella. The main stem is very strong and has a bladelike upper part. It is found only in Hekou, Yunnan, on the border with Vietnam, where the type was collected. The typical form occurs mainly in lowland forests along riverbanks at 100-200 m in elevation, while another form was found only on limestone hills from 300-500 m, in monsoon semi-evergreen rain forests. The two forms differ much in branching patterns and leaf shape and margin. The two forms could be different species, but they share most of the common important characters, e.g., the stem, leaf, strobilus, and spores. Further studies are needed to better ascertain their delimitation.

200004731 | Pleocnemia conjugata (Blume) C. Presl (Aspidium conjugatum Blume) was reported from Hong Kong (Holttum, 1974) and later also reported from Hainan (T. L. Wu et al., Fl. Guangdong 7: 248. 2006). While studying the specimens on which these reports were based, it was noticed that they belong to P. winitii. They were confused with P. conjugata due to the presence of indusia. The presence or absence of indusia in P. winitii does not appear to be constant; specimens are not always exindusiate. Besides a difference in the perispore, the stipe scales are the most obvious character to distinguish between P. winitii (entire scales) and P. conjugata (conspicuously dentate scales).

242414466 | Tectaria harlandii is commonly segregated into the genus Hemigramma because of its dimorphic leaves with contracted fertile fronds and linear sori that cover the entire abaxial surface of the blade when mature. Molecular evidence has shown however that this species is part of a greater Tectaria clade and cannot be maintained in a separate genus. The characters separating Hemigramma from Tectaria are minor and are known to occur in other species of Tectaria in other parts of the world.
242414466 | Polypodium dimorphum Baker (Ann. Bot. 5: 477. 1891, not Link (1833), described from Hainan) probably belongs here as the isotype sheet in BM was so annotated by Ching.

250098752 | The unusual spelling "zeilanica" is published as such and is to be maintained. It should not be corrected into the more common "zeylanica" or "ceylanica." Tectaria zeilanica was previously most commonly treated as the separate monotypic genus Quercifilix, but molecular evidence shows that this genus is embedded within the greater Tectaria clade. The species is easily recognized by its small size, its coarsely crenate sterile leaves (that somewhat resemble those of Quercus, hence the name), and its trifoliate, strongly contracted fertile leaves, with anastomosing sori that cover the entire lower side of the lamina when mature.

200004001 | According to the authors study, Cyclosorus latipinnus is a species of variable size, not always a small plant as described in FRPS (4(1): 227. 1999), so many names are treated as synonyms here. Characters such as venation, capitate glandular hairs, and spore ornamentation are similar.
200004001 | Holttum (Kew Bull. 31: 324. 1976; Fl. Males., Ser. 2, 1. 1982) treated both Cyclosorus latipinnus and C. jaculosus as synonyms of Christella subpubescens (Blume) Holttum (Aspidium subpubescens Blume; Cyclosorus subpubescens (Blume) Ching; Thelypteris subpubescens (Blume) K. Iwatsuki), which makes C. subpubescens a complex and confused species. We found that C. jaculosus and C. latipinnus are two distinct species, so the application of the name C. subpubescens is questionable. Pending detailed studies of the type, we maintain the use of the name C. latipinnus.

200004003 | According to Iwatsuki (Fl. Thailand 3: 424. 1988) and K. H. Shing (FRPS 4(1): 198. 1999), Cyclosorus molliusculus is distributed from SW China to Thailand. However, the present authors found that the specimens from S Yunnan, although similar in outline, are quite different from those from SE Xizang, Nepal, and N India. It may be questionable to use this name to represent the plants from Guangxi, Guizhou, and S Yunnan. As this problem cannot be resolved here, for the purposes of this treatment, we temporarily follow the treatments of Shing (loc. cit.) and Lu (Fl. Yunnan. 20: 605. 2006).

200004007 | The authors have not seen material of Cyclosorus parasiticus var. formosanus Ching (Bull. Fan Mem. Inst. Biol., Bot. 8: 205. 1938; Thelypteris parasitica var. formosana (Ching) C. F. Reed), described from Taiwan.
200004007 | The type of Cyclosorus brevipes Ching ex K. H. Shing (FRPS 4(1): 336. 1999) is partly bipinnate-pinnatifid with veins and glands similar to those of C. parasiticus. It has no sori and only one gathering has been collected. This taxon might be a hybrid.
200004007 | The type of Cyclosorus pauciserratus Ching & C. F. Zhang (Bull. Bot. Res., Harbin 3(3): 8. 1983) has no mature sori. Only one gathering has been made. This taxon might represent a young frond of C. parasiticus.

200004009 | Cyclosorus procurrens is quite similar to C. parasiticus and differs only in being eglandular on the pinnae. But there are many intermediate specimens. Holttum (Kew Bull. 31: 309. 1976) regarded C. procurrens as a synonym of C. parasiticus. This treatment seems reasonable but we cannot confirm it. Based on similar morphology, these two species probably belong to the same complex.

242323432 | "Glaphyropteridopsis erubescens var. mollis" (Ching, Vasc. Pl. Hengduan Mount. 1: 97. 1993) was not validly published because no Latin description or diagnosis, or reference to such, was provided and no type was indicated (Melbourne Code, Art. 39.1 and 40.1). The name "Christella erubescens" (H. Léveillé, Fl. Kouy-Tchéou, 474-476. 1915) belongs here but is a nomen nudum and was not therefore validly published (Art. 38.1(a)).

200004032 | The nomenclatural history of this taxon is confusing. The epithet was introduced as a nomen nudum by Wallich (Numer. List, no. 327. 1829). Fée (Mém. Foug. 5: 243. 1852) made the combination "Phegopteris ornata" based on Wallichs name but provided no further information, so this name is another nomen nudum and was likewise not validly published (Melbourne Code, Art. 38.1(a)). Beddome (1864) provided the first actual description in his account of Polypodium ornatum in 1864, but unfortunately this name is a later homonym and is therefore illegitimate. The earliest legitimate name appears to be that of J. Smith in 1875, as his combination can be indirectly associated with Beddomes description through his citation of Wallich.

250098375 | On one page of the protologue (appendix, p. 321), the name is cited as "Cyclosorus" caoshanensis, but this is obviously a typographical error. It appears under the generic heading Parathelypteris with six other species of Parathelypteris, whereas numerous species of Cyclosorus appear later (pp. 331-350); it is not included in the index under Cyclosorus (p. 364); and the name appears as P. caoshanensis in the synopsis (p. ii), key (p. 32), main text (p. 50), and index (p. 377).

250098406 | The present authors have not seen a complete specimen of Pseudocyclosorus cavaleriei. The type of P. cavaleriei was collected by Cavalerie on 5 August 1903, from Guiyang Ging-yan (Tsin Gai), Guizhou province, no. 1244 (E). It has the middle part of the lamina and seven pairs of pinnae. Ching examined the specimen and identified it as Dryopteris tylodes in 1931. The species was included within Thelypteris esquirolii (Christ) Ching by Holttum in 1936 and later in P. esquirolii (species no. 21 in this account) (Holttum & Grimes, Kew Bull. 34: 514-515. 1980).
250098406 | The subrectangular rachises, opposite pinnae, and proximal pair of veinlets reaching bottom of sinuses suggest that the species should not be included in Pseudocyclosorus esquirolii, but is instead closer to P. tylodes. However, the sori attached on distal parts of veinlets and close to margins are different from those of specimens of P. tylodes. So, it is here treated as an independent species, and we hope that more specimens of this species will be collected for study.
